@Armenia:Economy

 Overview: Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had
 developed a more modern industrial sector, supplying machine building
 equipment, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics
 in exchange for raw materials and energy resources. Armenia is a large
 food importer and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The
 economic decline in recent years (1991-94) has been particularly
 severe due to the ongoing conflict over the ethnic Armenian-dominated
 region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Turkey have
 blockaded pipeline and railroad traffic to Armenia for its support of
 the Karabakh Armenians. This has left Armenia with chronic energy
 shortages because of a lack of capacity and frequent disruptions of
 natural gas deliveries through unstable Georgia, as well as
 difficulties in obtaining other types of fuel. In addition, bread is
 strictly rationed and there are shortages of other goods. In 1994, the
 economy seemed to bottom out. The government has managed to increase
 its financial and budgetary discipline, bringing inflation down from
 around 40% per month in first half 1994 to single digits in second
 half 1994 and the first quarter of 1995. A full economic recovery
 cannot be expected until the conflict is settled and the blockade
 lifted.

@Aruba:Economy

 Overview: Tourism is the mainstay of the Aruban economy, although
 offshore banking and oil refining and storage are also important. The
 rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade has resulted
 in a substantial expansion of other activities. Construction has
 boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985 level. Additionally,
 the reopening of the country's oil refinery in 1993, a major source of
 employment and foreign exchange earnings, has further spurred growth.
 Aruba's small labor force and less than 1% unemployment rate have led
 to a large number of unfilled job vacancies despite sharp rises in
 wage rates in recent years.

 Environment:
 current issues: endangered marine species include the manatee, seals,
 sea lions, turtles, and whales; driftnet fishing is exacerbating
 declining fish stocks and contributing to international disputes;

 natural hazards: icebergs common in Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and
 the northwestern Atlantic Ocean from February to August and have been
 spotted as far south as Bermuda and the Madeira Islands; icebergs from
 Antarctica occur in the extreme southern Atlantic Ocean; ships subject
 to superstructure icing in extreme northern Atlantic from October to
 May and extreme southern Atlantic from May to October; persistent fog
 can be a maritime hazard from May to September
 international agreements: NA

 Note: major choke points include the Dardanelles, Strait of Gibraltar,
 access to the Panama and Suez Canals; strategic straits include the
 Strait of Dover, Straits of Florida, Mona Passage, The Sound

@Australia:Economy

 Overview: Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy,
 with a per capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West
 European countries. Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major
 exporter of agricultural products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels.
 Primary products account for more than 60% of the value of total
 exports, so that, as in 1983-84, a downturn in world commodity prices
 can have a big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for
 increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in
 international markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered
 from the low growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD
 countries in the early 1990s. In 1992-93 the economy recovered slowly
 from the prolonged recession of 1990-91, a major restraining factor
 being weak world demand for Australia's exports. Growth picked up so
 strongly in 1994 that the government felt the need for fiscal and
 monetary tightening by yearend. Australia's GDP grew 6.4% in 1994,
 largely due to increases in industrial output and business investment.
 A severe drought in 1994 is expected to reduce the value of
 Australia's net farm production by $825 million in the twelve months
 through June 1995, but rising world commodity prices are likely to
 boost rural exports by 7.7% to $14.5 billion in 1995/96, according to
 government statistics.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $374.6 billion (1994
 est.)

@Austria:Economy

 Overview: Austria boasts a prosperous and stable market economy with a
 sizable but falling proportion of nationalized industry and with
 extensive welfare benefits. Thanks to its raw material endowment, a
 technically skilled labor force, and strong links to German industrial
 firms, Austria occupies specialized niches in European industry and
 services (tourism, banking) and produces almost enough food to feed
 itself with only 8% of the labor force in agriculture. After 11
 consecutive years of growth, the Austrian economy experienced a mild
 recession in 1993, but growth resumed in 1994. Unemployment is 4.3%
 and will likely stay at that level as companies adjust to the
 competition of EU membership beginning 1 January 1995. To prepare for
 EU membership, Austria's government has taken measures to open the
 economy by introducing a major tax reform, privatizing state-owned
 firms, and liberalizing cross-border capital movements. Problems for
 the 1990s include an aging population, the high level of industrial
 subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary
 capabilities - the deficit climbed to over 4% of GDP in 1994.

AZERBAIJAN

 Note--Azerbaijan continues to be plagued by an unresolved
 seven-year-old conflict with Armenian separatists over its
 Nagorno-Karabakh region. The Karabakh Armenians have declared
 independence and seized almost 20% of the country's territory,
 creating almost 1 million Azeri displaced persons in the process. Both
 sides have generally observed a Russian-mediated cease-fire in place
 since May 1994, and support the OSCE-mediated peace process, now
 entering its fourth year. Nevertheless, Baku and Xankandi
 (Stepanakert) remain far apart on most substantive issues from the
 placement and composition of a peacekeeping force to the enclave's
 ultimate political status, and prospects for a negotiated settlement
 remain dim.

 Nagorno-Karabakh region; the region's autonomy was abolished by
 Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet on 26 November 1991

@Azerbaijan:Economy

 Overview: Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either
 Armenia or Georgia, the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the
 Central Asian states in its majority nominally Muslim population, high
 structural unemployment, and low standard of living. The economy's
 most prominent products are oil, cotton, and gas. Production from the
 Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline for several years, but
 the November 1994 ratification of the $7.5 billion oil deal with a
 consortium of Western companies should generate the funds needed to
 spur future industrial development. Azerbaijan accounted for 1.5% to
 2% of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet Union.
 Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet
 republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy,
 but its considerable energy resources brighten its long-term
 prospects. Baku has only recently begun making progress on economic
 reform, and old economic ties and structures have yet to be replaced.
