Economy

Economy - overview: Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the
public sector accounting for roughly half of GDP. Tourism is a major
source of foreign exchange, and agriculture is self-sufficient, except
for meat, dairy products, and animal feedstuffs. Macroeconomic
problems include mediocre GDP growth, the huge public sector,
substantial budget deficits, and 10% unemployment. The government's
hard drachma policy and public sector wage restraint are largely
responsible for the downward trend in inflation, now at the lowest
level in 22 years. Investment is likely to be the primary engine for
economic growth in 1997. Athens continues to rely heavily on EU aid,
which currently amounts to about 4% of GDP. Despite widespread
protests from unions and farmers, Prime Minister SIMITIS presented a
tough 1997 budget to help bring Greece closer to meeting the EU
criteria for participating in economic and monetary union. SIMITIS
faces strong opposition to further privatization and further
austerity. Plans to increase defense spending could undermine
SIMITIS's goal to curb government expenditures.

Economy

Economy - overview: Greenland suffered negative economic growth in the
early 1990s, but since 1993 the economy has improved. Nonetheless,
prospects for substantial economic growth in the near future are poor.
The Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a light fiscal
policy since the late 1980s which has helped create surpluses in the
public budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered
a foreign trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining
lead and zinc mine in 1989. Greenland today is critically dependent on
fishing and fish exports; the shrimp fishery is by far the largest
income earner. Despite resumption of several interesting hydrocarbon
and minerals exploration activities, it will take several years before
production can materialize. Tourism is the only sector offering any
near term potential and even this is limited due to a short season and
high costs. The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises
and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in Greenland's
economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the
Danish Government, an important supplement of GDP.

Economy

Economy - overview: The agriculturally based economy was hurt in 1996
by the emergence of the pink mealy bug which destroyed much of the
cocoa harvest. Bananas, a major foreign exchange earner, also suffered
due to falling prices, low production, and poor quality. Tourism, the
leading foreign exchange earner, continued to do well, as did
manufacturing. Construction boomed in 1996 due to concessions for low
and middle income mortgages. The government introduced a 5% tax on
electricity and telephones and doubled the general consumption tax,
which caused a small rise in the inflation rate. The tourist industry
faces stiff competition over the next few years.

Economy

Economy - overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light
industry, and services. It is also dependent upon France for large
subsidies and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists
from the US. In addition, an increasingly large number of cruise ships
visit the islands. The traditionally important sugarcane crop is
slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now
supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other
vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption,
although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, which comes
mainly from France. Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum
production. Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported.
Unemployment is especially high among the young.

Economy

are imported, with about 75% from the US. Guam faces the problem of
building up the civilian economic sector to offset the impact of
military downsizing.
