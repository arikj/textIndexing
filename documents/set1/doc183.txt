Economy

Economy - overview: Madagascar suffers from chronic malnutrition,
underfunded health and education facilities, a roughly 3% annual
population growth rate, and severe loss of forest cover, accompanied
by erosion. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the
mainstay of the economy, accounting for 33% of GDP and contributing
more than 70% to export earnings. Industry features the processing of
agricultural products and textile manufacturing. Growth in output in
1992-95 averaged only 1.4%, less than half the growth rate of the
population. Growth has been held back by antigovernment strikes and
demonstrations, a decline in world coffee demand, and the erratic
commitment of the government to economic reform. Formidable obstacles
stand in the way of Madagascar's realizing its considerable growth
potential; the extent of government reforms, outside financial aid,
and foreign investment will be key determinants.

Economy

Economy - overview: Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's least
developed countries. The economy is predominately agricultural, with
about 90% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture
accounts for 45% of GDP and 90% of export revenues. The economy
depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF,
the World Bank, and individual donor nations. The new government faces
strong challenges, e.g., to spur exports, to improve educational and
health facilities, and to deal with environmental problems of
deforestation and erosion.

Economy

Economy - overview: The Malaysian economy, a mixture of private
enterprise and public management, has posted a remarkable record of 9%
average annual growth in 1988-96. This growth has resulted in a
substantial reduction in poverty and a marked rise in real wages. In
1996 manufactured goods exports expanded less rapidly than in previous
years because of the global slump in electronics; nonetheless, foreign
investors continue to commit large sums in the economy. The government
is aware of the inflationary potential of this rapid development and
is closely monitoring fiscal and monetary policies.

Economy

Economy - overview: During the 1980s tourism became one of the most
important and highest growth sectors of the economy. In 1994, tourism,
Maldives largest industry, accounted for about 18% of GDP and more
than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Fishing is a
second leading growth sector. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes
from import duties and tourism-related taxes. The Maldivian Government
initiated an economic reform program in 1989 initially by lifting
import quotas and opening some exports to the private sector.
Subsequently, it has liberalized regulations to allow more foreign
investment. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a minor
role in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of
cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labor. Most staple foods
must be imported. In 1994, industry which consisted mainly of garment
production, boat building, and handicrafts accounted for about 15% of
GDP.

Economy

Economy - overview: Mali is among the poorest countries in the world,
with 65% of its land area desert or semidesert. Economic activity is
largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger. About
10% of the population is nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is
engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on
processing farm commodities. Mali is heavily dependent on foreign aid
and vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for cotton, its main
export. Nonetheless the government has successfully implemented an
IMF-recommended structural adjustment program that is helping the
economy grow, diversify, and attract foreign investment. Mali's
adherence to economic reform, and the 50% devaluation of the African
Franc in January 1994, has pushed up economic growth. Several
multinational corporations increased gold mining operations in 1996
and the government projects that Mali will become a major Sub-Saharan
gold exporter in the next few years.
