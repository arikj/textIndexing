@Mozambique:Economy

 Overview: One of Africa's poorest countries, Mozambique has failed to
 exploit the economic potential of its sizable agricultural,
 hydropower, and transportation resources. Indeed, national output,
 consumption, and investment declined throughout the first half of the
 1980s because of internal disorders, lack of government administrative
 control, and a growing foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid,
 attracted by an economic reform policy, resulted in successive years
 of economic growth in the late 1980s, but aid has declined steadily
 since 1989. Agricultural output is at only 75% of its 1981 level, and
 grain has to be imported. Industry operates at only 20%-40% of
 capacity. The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep
 afloat. Peace accords signed in October 1992 improved chances of
 foreign investment, aided IMF-supported economic reforms, and
 supported continued economic recovery. Elections held in 1994 diverted
 government attention from the economy, resulting in slippage and
 delays in the economic reform program. Nonetheless, growth in 1994 was
 solid and can continue into the late 1990s given continued foreign
 help in meeting debt obligations.

@Namibia:Economy

 Overview: The economy is heavily dependent on the mining industry to
 extract and process minerals for export. Mining accounts for almost
 25% of GDP. Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals
 in Africa and the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial
 diamond deposits are among the richest in the world, making Namibia a
 primary source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large
 quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver, and tungsten. More than half
 the population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence
 agriculture) for its livelihood. Namibia must import some of its food.

@Nauru:Economy

 Overview: Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves of
 which are expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have
 given Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third
 World. Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be
 imported, including fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of
 mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious
 long-term problems. Substantial amounts of phosphate income are
 invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition.

@Nepal:Economy

 Overview: Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in
 the world. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a
 livelihood for over 90% of the population and accounting for half of
 GDP. Industrial activity is limited, mainly involving the processing
 of agricultural produce (jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain).
 Production of textiles and carpets has expanded recently and accounted
 for 85% of foreign exchange earnings in FY93/94. Apart from
 agricultural land and forests, exploitable natural resources are mica,
 hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production in the late 1980s
 grew by about 5%, as compared with annual population growth of 2.6%.
 More than 40% of the population is undernourished. Since May 1991, the
 government has been encouraging trade and foreign investment, e.g., by
 eliminating business licenses and registration requirements in order
 to simplify domestic and foreign investment. The government also has
 been cutting public expenditures by reducing subsidies, privatizing
 state industries, and laying off civil servants. Prospects for foreign
 trade and investment in the 1990s remain poor, however, because of the
 small size of the economy, its technological backwardness, its
 remoteness, and susceptibility to natural disaster. The international
 community provides funding for 70% of Nepal's developmental budget and
 for 30% of total budgetary expenditures. The government, realizing
 that attempts to reverse three years of liberalization would
 jeopardize this vital support, almost certainly will move ahead with
 its reform program in 1995-96.

@Netherlands:Economy

 Overview: This highly developed and affluent economy is based on
 private enterprise. The government makes its presence felt, however,
 through many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare programs
 affecting most aspects of economic activity. The trade and financial
 services sector contributes over 50% of GDP. Industrial activity
 provides about 25% of GDP and is led by the food-processing,
 oil-refining, and metalworking industries. The highly mechanized
 agricultural sector employs only 4% of the labor force, but provides
 large surpluses for export and the domestic food-processing industry.
 Indeed the Netherlands ranks third worldwide in value of agricultural
 exports, behind the US and France. High unemployment and a sizable
 budget deficit are currently the most serious economic problems. Many
 of the economic issues of the 1990s will reflect the course of
 European economic integration.
