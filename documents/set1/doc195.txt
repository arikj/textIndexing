Economy

Economy - overview: Since the establishment of the Slovak Republic on
1 January 1993, Slovakia has continued the difficult transformation
from a centrally controlled economy to a modern market-oriented
economy. Macroeconomic performance improved steadily in 1994-96, but
privatization progressed only in fits and starts. Strong export
performance boosted GDP growth to 4.8% in 1994 after a four-year
decline. GDP surged to 7.4% growth in 1995 and should be only slightly
less in 1996, the fastest growth in Central and Eastern Europe.
Unemployment fell to about 12% in 1996 and inflation dropped from 26%
in 1993 to 5.5% in 1996, the lowest in the region. Foreign debt of
$4.6 billion also is the lowest in the region and the second lowest
per capita. Private activity now makes up roughly two-thirds of GDP.
Positive international financial performance has led Standard & Poor's
to raise its rating of the National Bank of Slovakia's foreign
currency debt to just one step below investment grade. Although Slovak
economic performance continues to be impressive, many warning signs of
possible danger ahead have been raised. Aggregate demand has surged in
the form of increased personal and government consumption. At the same
time that the budget deficit is growing, the money supply has been
rapidly increasing, which could apply upward pressure on inflation.
The trade and current account deficits both are mounting as imports
soar and exports sag. Perhaps most troubling, Slovakia continues to
have difficulty attracting foreign investment because of perceived
political problems and halting progress on restructuring and
privatization. The government projects 6.4% growth in 1997 and 5% in
1998. Continuing economic recovery in western Europe should boost
exports and production, but Slovakia's image with foreign creditors
and investors could suffer setbacks in 1997 if progress on
privatization and restructuring stalls.

Economy

Economy - overview: Slovenia appears to be making a solid economic
recovery, fulfilling the promise it showed at the time of Yugoslavia's
breakup. Its per capita GDP is now the highest in Central and Eastern
Europe and comparable to the levels in the poorer West European
countries. Slovenia has benefited from strong ties to Western Europe
and suffered comparatively small physical damage during Yugoslavia's
breakup. The beginning was difficult, however. Real GDP fell 15% in
1991-92, while inflation soared to 200% in 1992. The turning point
came in 1993, when real GDP grew 1%, unemployment leveled off, and
inflation slowed dramatically. In 1994, real GDP rose 5.5%, tapering
off to an estimated 3.5% in 1995 and an estimated 3% in 1996. The
government gets good marks from foreign observers for fiscal policy -
the budget deficit has not exceeded 1% of GDP in any year since 1991,
and the current account balance has remained in surplus throughout the
transition period, with the exception of 1995-96. The Slovene
privatization program, which began in 1994, involves about 1,400
firms, but less than half have been privatized. Growth in the near
term depends largely on economic revitalization in Western Europe
which buys 70% of Slovenia's exports. Slovenia itself must press on
with privatization, restructuring, the encouragement of foreign
investment, and the maintenance of a stable tolar.

Economy

Economy - overview: The bulk of the population depend on subsistence
agriculture, fishing, and forestry for at least part of their
livelihood. Most manufactured goods and petroleum products must be
imported. The islands are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such
as lead, zinc, nickel, and gold. The Government of the Solomon Islands
is nearing financial insolvency. In mid-1995 the central bank
suspended interest and principal payments on government bonds and
treasury bills held by financial institutions and the general public.
The government so far has taken no steps to restrain expenditure or
address the deficit, which is expected to be considerably higher than
the $20 million forecasted in the 1996 budget.

account of refugee movements and of losses due to famine; lower
estimates of Somalia's population in mid-1996 (on the order of 6.0
million to 6.5 million) have been made by aid and relief agencies,
based on the number of persons being fed; population counting in
Somalia is complicated by the large numbers of nomads and by refugee

Economy

Economy - overview: One of the world's poorest and least developed
countries, Somalia has few resources. Moreover, much of the economy
has been devastated by the civil war. Agriculture is the most
important sector, with livestock accounting for about 40% of GDP and
about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and seminomads, who are dependent
upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion of the
population. Crop production generates only 10% of GDP and employs
about 20% of the work force. The main export crop is bananas; sugar,
sorghum, and corn are grown for the domestic market. The small
industrial sector is based on the processing of agricultural products
and accounts for less than 10% of GDP; most facilities have been shut
down because of the civil strife. The greatly increased political
turmoil of 1991-93 resulted in a substantial drop in agricultural
output, with widespread famine. In 1994 economic conditions stabilized
in the countryside, followed in 1995 by slight improvements. However,
ongoing civil strife in Mogadishu and outlying areas is interfering
with any substantial recovery.

Economy

Economy - overview: Despite the efforts of South Africa's first
majority-run government, income inequality remains among the world's
most extreme. Many of the white one-seventh of the South African
population enjoy incomes, material comforts, and health and
educational standards equal to those of Western Europe. In contrast,
most of the remaining population suffers from the poverty patterns of
the Third World, including unemployment, lack of job skills, and bleak
living conditions. The main strength of the economy lies in its rich
mineral resources, which provide two-thirds of exports. Economic
developments for the remainder of the 1990s will be driven largely by
the new government's attempts to improve black living standards, to
set the country on a steady export-led growth path, and to cut back
the enormous numbers of unemployed. The economy in recent years has
absorbed less than 5% of the more than 300,000 workers entering the
labor force annually. Local economists estimate that the economy must
grow at least 5% in real terms annually to absorb all of the new
entrants, much less reduce the accumulated total.
