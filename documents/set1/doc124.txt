@Gibraltar:Economy

 Overview: Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade and
 offshore banking. The British military presence has been severely
 reduced and now only contributes about 11% to the local economy. The
 financial sector accounts for 15% of GDP; tourism, shipping services
 fees, and duties on consumer goods also generate revenue. Because more
 than 70% of the economy is in the public sector, changes in government
 spending have a major impact on the level of employment.

@Greece:Economy

 Overview: Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the basic
 entrepreneurial system overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist system that
 enlarged the public sector from 55% of GDP in 1981 to about 70% in
 1989. Since then, the public sector has been reduced to about 60% of
 GDP. Tourism continues as a major source of foreign exchange, and
 agriculture is self-sufficient except for meat, dairy products, and
 animal feedstuffs. Over the last decade, real GDP growth has averaged
 1.6% a year, compared with the European Union average of 2.2%.
 Inflation continues to be well above the EU average, and the national
 debt has reached 140% of GDP, the highest in the EU. Prime Minister
 PAPANDREOU will probably make only limited progress correcting the
 economy's problems of high inflation, large budget deficit, and
 decaying infrastructure. His economic program suggests that although
 he will shun his expansionary policies of the 1980s, he will avoid
 tough measures needed to slow inflation or reduce the state's role in
 the economy. He has limited the previous government's privatization
 plans, for example, and has called for generous welfare spending and
 real wage increases. Athens continues to rely heavily on EU aid, which
 recently has amounted to about 6% of GDP. Greece almost certainly will
 not meet the EU's Maastricht Treaty convergence targets of public
 deficit held to 3% of GDP and national debt to 60% of GDP by 1999. Per
 capita GDP has fallen below Portugal's level, the lowest among EU
 members.

@Greenland:Economy

 Overview: Greenland's economic situation at present is difficult.
 Unemployment is increasing, and prospects for economic growth in the
 immediate future are dim. Following the closing of the Black Angel
 lead and zinc mine in 1989, Greenland became almost completely
 dependent on fishing and fish processing, the sector accounting for
 95% of exports. Prospects for fisheries are not bright, as the
 important shrimp catches will at best stabilize and cod catches have
 dropped. Resumption of mining and hydrocarbon activities is not around
 the corner, thus leaving only tourism with some potential for the near
 future. The public sector in Greenland, i.e., the central government
 and its commercial entities and the municipalities, plays a dominant
 role in Greenland accounting for about two-thirds of total employment.
 About half the government's revenues come from grants from the Danish
 Government.

 Overview: The economy is essentially agricultural and centers on the
 traditional production of spices and tropical plants. Agriculture
 accounts for about 15% of GDP and 80% of exports and employs 24% of
 the labor force. Tourism is the leading foreign exchange earner,
 followed by agricultural exports. Manufacturing remains relatively
 undeveloped, but is expected to grow, given a more favorable private
 investment climate since 1983. The economy achieved an impressive
 average annual growth rate of 5.5% in 1986-91 but has stalled since
 1992. Unemployment remains high at about 25%.

@Guadeloupe:Economy

 Overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry,
 and services. It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and
 imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In
 addition, an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the
 islands. The traditionally important sugarcane crop is slowly being
 replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50%
 of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root
 crops are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is
 still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly from France.
 Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production. Most
 manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially
 high among the young.

@Guam:Economy

 Overview: The economy depends mainly on US military spending and on
 revenues from tourism. Over the past 20 years the tourist industry has
 grown rapidly, creating a construction boom for new hotels and the
 expansion of older ones. Visitors numbered about 900,000 in 1992. The
 slowdown in Japanese economic growth has been reflected in less
 vigorous growth in the tourism sector. About 60% of the labor force
 works for the private sector and the rest for government. Most food
 and industrial goods are imported, with about 75% from the US. Guam
 faces the problem of building up the civilian economic sector to
 offset the impact of military downsizing.
