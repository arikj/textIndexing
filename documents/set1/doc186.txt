Economy

Economy - overview: The new government has embraced free-market
economics, freezing spending, easing price controls, liberalizing
domestic and international trade. Mongolia's severe climate, scattered
population, and wide expanses of unproductive land, however, have
constrained economic development. Economic activity traditionally has
been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock. In past years
extensive mineral resources had been developed with Soviet support;
total Soviet assistance at its height amounted to 30% of GDP. The
mining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and
gold account for a large part of industrial production. The dramatic
drop in the price of copper which accounts for half of the country's
export earnings, has held back economic growth. The Mongolian
leadership also has been soliciting support from international
financial agencies and foreign investors. The economy, however, has
still not recovered from the loss of Soviet aid. The country continues
to suffer substantial economic hardships, with one-fourth of the
population below the poverty line.

Economy

Economy - overview: The economy of this volcanic island is small and
open, with economic activity centered on tourism and related services.
Tourism accounts for roughly one-quarter of Montserrat's national
income. The island's main export is electronic components which are
mainly shipped to the US. The agriculture sector is small; cabbages,
carrots, cucumbers, and onions are grown for the domestic market;
additionally, some hot peppers and live plants are exported to the US
and Europe. Volcanic activity in late 1995 led to the repeated
evacuation of Montserrat's capital, Plymouth, and deep ash from the
volcano destroyed much of the yearend crops. These disruptions,
compounded by hurricanes, caused production in 1995 to drop
precipitously. The likely slow recovery of tourism and the continued
danger of an eruption dimmed the prospects for rapid recovery in 1996.

Economy

Economy - overview: Morocco faces the typical problems of developing
countries - restraining government spending, reducing constraints on
private activity and foreign trade, and keeping inflation within
manageable bounds. Since the early 1980s the government has pursued an
economic program toward these objectives with the support of the IMF,
the World Bank, and the Paris Club of creditors. The dirham is now
fully convertible for current account transactions; reforms of the
financial sector have been implemented; and 43 state enterprises have
been privatized. Drought conditions in three of the last four years
have depressed activity in the key agricultural sector, holding down
exports and contributing to a 7.5% contraction in real GDP in 1995.
Favorable rainfall in 1996 nurtured a record wheat crop and
contributed to the 9% overall growth. Servicing the large external
debt, preparing the economy for freer trade with the European Union,
and finding jobs for Morocco's youthful population remain long-term
problems.

Economy

Economy - overview: One of Africa's poorest countries, Mozambique has
failed to exploit the economic potential of its sizable agricultural,
hydropower, and transportation resources. Agricultural output is at
only 75% of its 1981 level, and grain has to be imported. Industry
operates at only 20%-40% of capacity. Foreign assistance programs
supply the foreign exchange required to pay for imports of goods and
services. The peace accord, signed in October 1992, has improved
Mozambique's prospects. The restoration of electrical transmission
lines to South Africa and the completion of a new transmission line to
Zimbabwe (permitting the giant Cahora Bassa hydropower plant to export
large amounts of electricity), proposed construction of a natural gas
pipeline to South Africa, and reform of transportation services will
greatly improve foreign exchange receipts. The Mozambique and South
African governments are developing the Maputo corridor, linking the
port of Maputo with Witbank, South Africa. In the past few years, more
than 500 state enterprises have been privatized, including the
country's largest commercial bank and a number of sizable
manufacturing firms. Other pending reform measures are the
privatization of customs operations, the reform of tax collection, and
the facilitation of private enterprise in the transportation, energy,
and telecommunications sectors.

Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is heavily dependent on the extraction
and processing of minerals for export. Mining accounts for almost 25%
of GDP. Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in
Africa and the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Rich
alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for
gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead,
zinc, tin, silver, and tungsten. Half of the population depends on
agriculture (largely subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood.
Namibia must import some of its food.

Economy

Economy - overview: Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the
reserves of which are expected to be exhausted by the year 2000.
Phosphates have given Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes
in the Third World, but incomes probably will drop sharply in the
future. Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be
imported, including fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of
mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious
long-term problems. Substantial amounts of phosphate income are
invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition. However,
dividends from the trusts have declined sharply since 1990 and the
government has been borrowing heavily from the trusts to finance
fiscal deficits. In an effort to stem further escalation of fiscal
problems, the FY96/97 budget calls for a freeze on government wages
for two years, a reduction of over-staffed public service departments,
drastic cutbacks in hiring new government staff, privatization of
numerous government agencies, and closure of some overseas consulates.
