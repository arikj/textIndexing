Economy

Economy - overview: The Nicaraguan economy, devastated during the
1980s by economic mismanagement and civil war, is beginning to
rebound. Since March 1991, when President CHAMORRO launched an
ambitious economic stabilization program, Nicaragua has reduced
inflation and obtained substantial economic aid from abroad. Annual
inflation fell from more than 750% in 1991 to less than 5% in 1992.
After rising again to an estimated 20% in 1993, the annual inflation
rate dropped to roughly 11% in 1994-96. Economic growth rose sharply
in 1995-96, thanks to surges in most export categories. The
government's efforts to liberalize trade include a December 1995
decision to stop requiring exporters to bring their foreign exchange
earnings into Nicaragua. On the debt front, the Nicaraguan Government
launched a successful debt buyback program in 1995, purchasing 73% of
its $1.373 billion commercial debt inherited from previous
governments. Progress also occurred on reducing bilateral debt in 1996
as Nicaragua reached an agreement with Russia, reducing Nicaragua's
debt by $3.3 billion. Debt reduction agreements with Paris Club
creditors and rescheduling with Latin American creditors also took
place. Unemployment remains a pressing problem, however, with roughly
half the country's work force unemployed or underemployed.

Economy

Economy - overview: Niger is a poor, landlocked Sub-Saharan nation,
whose recent GDP growth has barely matched the rapid growth of
population. The economy is centered on subsistence agriculture, animal
husbandry, and reexport trade, and increasingly less on uranium, its
major export throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Terms of trade with
Nigeria, Niger's largest regional trade partner, have improved
dramatically since the 50% devaluation of the African franc in January
1994; this devaluation boosted exports of livestock, peas, onions, and
the products of Niger's small cotton industry. The government relies
on bilateral and multilateral aid for operating expenses and public
investment and is strongly induced to adhere to structural adjustment
programs designed by the IMF and the World Bank. The US terminated
bilateral assistance to Niger after the coup of 1996. Other donors
have reduced their aid.

Economy

Economy - overview: The oil-rich Nigerian economy continues to be
hobbled by political instability, corruption, and poor macroeconomic
management. Nigeria's unpopular military rulers have failed to make
significant progress in diversifying the economy away from
overdependence on the capital intensive oil sector which provides half
of GDP, 95% of foreign exchange earnings, and about 80% of budgetary
revenues. Regime officials also appear divided on how to redress
fundamental economic imbalances that result in troublesome inflation
and the discouragement of investors. The government's resistance to
initiating greater transparency and accountability in managing the
country's multibillion dollar oil earnings continues to limit economic
growth and prevent an agreement with the IMF and bilateral creditors
on debt relief. The largely subsistence agricultural sector has failed
to keep up with rapid population growth, and Nigeria, once a large net
exporter of food, now must import food. Agricultural production in
1996 suffered from severe shortages of fertilizer.

Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New
Zealand as Niue has no indigenous export product. Government
expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall made up by
grants from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages to public
employees. Niue has cut government expenditures in 1994-96, however,
by reducing the public service by almost half. The agricultural sector
consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are
grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small factories to
process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of
postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of
revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of
population because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand.

has brought a level of prosperity unusual among inhabitants of the
Pacific islands. The number of visitors has increased steadily over
the years and reached 29,000 in FY88/89. Revenues from tourism have
given the island a favorable balance of trade and helped the
agricultural sector to become self-sufficient in the production of
beef, poultry, and eggs.

Economy

Economy - overview: The economy benefits substantially from financial
assistance from the US. The rate of funding has declined as locally
generated government revenues have grown. An agreement for the years
1986 to 1992 entitled the islands to $228 million for capital
development, government operations, and special programs. Since 1992,
funding has been extended one year at a time. The commonwealth
received $27.7 million from FY93/94 through FY95/96. For FY96/97
through FY02/03, funding of $11 million will be provided for
infrastructure, with an equal local match. A rapidly growing major
source of income is the tourist industry, which now employs about 50%
of the work force. Japanese tourists predominate. The agricultural
sector is of minor importance and is made up of cattle ranches and
small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons.
Industry is small scale, mostly handicrafts, light manufacturing, and
garment production.
