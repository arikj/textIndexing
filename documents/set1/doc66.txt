@Armenia, Economy

Overview: 
  Under the old central planning system, Armenia had built up a
  developed industrial sector, supplying machine building equipment,
  textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange
  for raw materials and energy resources. Armenia is a large food
  importer and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The
  economic decline in the past three years (1991-93) has been
  particularly severe due to the ongoing conflict over the Armenian
  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Turkey have
  blockaded pipeline and railroad traffic to Armenia for its support of
  the Karabakh Armenians. This has left Armenia with only sporadic
  deliveries of natural gas through unstable Georgia, while other fuel
  and raw materials are in critical short supply. Inflation, roughly 14%
  per month in the first nine months of 1993, surged even higher in the
  fourth quarter. In late 1993, most industrial enterprises were either
  shut down or operating at drastically reduced levels. Only small
  quantities of food were available (mostly humanitarian aid), heat was
  nonexistent, and electricity strictly rationed. An economic recovery
  cannot be expected until the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is settled and
  until transportation through Georgia improves.
National product: 
  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $7.1 billion (1993 estimate from
  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and
  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993; and as
  extrapolated to 1993 using official Armenian statistics, which are
  very uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)
National product real growth rate: 
  -9.9% (1993 est.)
National product per capita: 
  $2,040 (1993 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices): 
  14% per month average (first 9 months, 1993)
Unemployment rate: 
  6.5% of officially registered unemployed but large numbers of
  underemployed (1993 est.)
Budget:

  processed food items, alcoholic products (1991)

  (1.9%), electric motors (9%), tires (1.5%), knitted wear (4.4%),
  hosiery (3.0%), shoes (2.2%), silk fabric (0.8%), washing machines
  (2.0%), chemicals, trucks, watches, instruments, and microelectronics
  (1990); currently, much of industry is shut down
Agriculture: 
  accounts for about 45% of GDP; only 17% of land area is arable;
  employs 20%-30% of labor force as residents increasingly turn to
  subsistence agriculture; fruits (especially grapes) and vegetable
  farming, minor livestock sector; vineyards near Yerevan are famous for
  brandy and other liqueurs
Illicit drugs: 
  illicit cultivator of cannabis mostly for domestic consumption; used
  as a transshipment point for illicit drugs to Western Europe
Economic aid: 
recipient: 
  considerable humanitarian aid, mostly food and energy products, from
  US and EC; Russia has granted 60 billion rubles in technical credits

  Unemployment has steadily declined from about 20% in 1986 to about 3%
  in 1991 and to less than 1% in 1992. The reopening of the local oil

@Australia, Economy

Overview: 
  Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy, with a
  per capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West European
  countries. Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of
  agricultural products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Primary
  products account for more than 60% of the value of total exports, so
  that, as in 1983-84, a downturn in world commodity prices can have a
  big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for increased
  exports of manufactured goods, but competition in international
  markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered from the low
  growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD countries in the
  early 1990s. In 1992-93 the economy recovered slowly from the
  prolonged recession of 1990-91, a major restraining factor being weak
  world demand for Australia's exports. Unemployment has hovered around
  10% and probably will remain at that level in 1994 as productivity
  gains rather than more jobs account for growth.

@Austria, Economy

Overview: 
  Austria boasts a prosperous and stable socialist market economy with a
  sizable but falling proportion of nationalized industry and extensive
  welfare benefits. Thanks to its raw material endowment, a technically
  skilled labor force, and strong links to German industrial firms,
  Austria occupies specialized niches in European industry and services
  (tourism, banking) and produces almost enough food to feed itself with
  only 8% of the labor force in agriculture. Increased export sales
  resulting from German unification, boosted Austria's economy through
  1991, but Austria's GDP growth slowed to 2% in 1992 and -0.5% in 1993
  due to the weak international economy, particularly in Germany - its
  largest trading partner. GDP growth will resume slowly in 1994, with
  estimates ranging from a 0.5% to a 1% increase. Unemployment has risen
  to 7% as a result of the slowdown and will continue to rise in 1994.
  Problems for the l990s include an aging population, the high level of
  subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary
  capabilities. Austria's government has taken measures to make the
  economy more liberal and open by introducing a major tax reform,
  privatizing state-owned firms, and liberalizing cross-border capital
  movements. Although it will face increased competition, Austria should
  benefit from the continued opening of eastern European markets, as
  well as the 1 January 1994 start of the European Economic Area which
  extends the European Union rules on the free movement of people,
  capital, and goods and services to four members (including Austria) of
  the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Austria has concluded
  membership negotiations with the European Union and is expected to
  join in early 1995, thus broadening European economic unity. The
  government, however, plans to hold a national referendum on the matter
  on 12 June 1994; support for and opposition to membership appears
  about equal.

@Azerbaijan, Economy

Overview: 
  Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia or
  Georgia, the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central
  Asian states in its majority Muslim population, high structural
  unemployment, and low standard of living. The economy's most prominent
  products are oil, cotton, and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and
  gas field has been in decline for several years. With foreign
  assistance, the oil industry might generate the funds needed to spur
  industrial development. However, civil unrest, marked by armed
  conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Muslim Azeris and
  Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan
  accounted for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former
  Soviet Union. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the
  ex-Soviet republics in making the transition from a command to a
  market economy, but its considerable energy resources brighten its
  prospects somewhat. Old economic ties and structures have yet to be
  replaced. A particularly galling constraint on economic revival is the
  Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, said to consume 25% of Azerbaijan's
  economic resources.
National product: 
  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $15.5 billion (1993 estimate from
  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and

  very uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)
