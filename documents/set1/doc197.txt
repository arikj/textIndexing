Economy

Economy - overview: Coal mining is the major economic activity on
Svalbard. By treaty (9 February 1920), the nationals of the treaty
powers have equal rights to exploit mineral deposits, subject to
Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal
companies have mined in the past, the only companies still mining are
Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are essentially
company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs nearly
60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local
services, and provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also
some trapping of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.

Economy

Economy - overview: This small landlocked economy is based largely on
subsistence agriculture, which occupies more than 60% of the
population. Manufacturing features a number of agroprocessing
factories. Mining has declined in importance in recent years;
high-grade iron ore deposits were depleted by 1978, and health
concerns have cut world demand for asbestos. Exports of soft drink
concentrate, sugar and wood pulp are the main earners of hard
currency. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with
Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa from which
it receives nearly 90% of its imports and to which it sends more than
half of its exports. Remittances from Swazi workers in South African
mines supplement domestically earned income by as much as 20%. The
government is trying to improve the atmosphere for foreign investment.
Overgrazing, soil depletion, and drought persist as problems for the
future.

Economy

Economy - overview: Aided by peace and neutrality for the whole
twentieth century, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living
under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare
benefits. It has a modern distribution system, excellent internal and
external communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber,
hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy
heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account
for about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering sector
accounts for 50% of output and exports. Agriculture accounts for only
2% of GDP and 2% of the jobs. In recent years, however, this
extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by budgetary
difficulties, inflation, growing unemployment, and a gradual loss of
competitiveness in international markets. To curb the budget deficit
and bolster confidence in the economy, the government adopted an
adjustment program in November 1994 that aims to eliminate the
government budget deficit and to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio.
Sweden has harmonized its economic policies with those of the EU,
which it joined at the start of 1995.

Economy

Economy - overview: Switzerland, a fundamentally prosperous and stable
modern economy with a per capita GDP roughly 10% above that of the big
West European economies, is experiencing continued economic
difficulties. GDP has dropped for five consecutive quarters,
unemployment is reaching record levels, and the fiscal deficit is
again above 3% of GDP. In 1997, growth may reach barely 0.6%; a
recovery is not likely before mid to late 1997. Weak domestic consumer
demand is partly at fault; declining real disposable income is
combining with a reluctance to reduce saving rates in the face of an
uncertain employment outlook. Switzerland's leading sectors, including
financial services, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and
special-purpose machines, will therefore be more reliant on export
markets at the same time they are being squeezed by the strong franc.
Consequently, growth in machinery and equipment investment, for
example, is expected to taper off. On the other side, import growth in
1997 also is likely to be lower than the 1995 rate of 6.6%, but higher
than 1996's expected 1.9%.

Economy

Economy - overview: Sheltered from the pressures of the international
marketplace for almost three decades, Syria's predominantly statist
economy is on a weak footing because of Damascus's failure to
implement extensive economic reform. After an economic rebound in the
early 1990s in the wake of the Persian Gulf war, economic growth has
slowed as the traditionally volatile economy has once again slumped.
Current account and budget deficits and inflation are increasing. The
dominant agricultural sector remains underdeveloped, with roughly 80%
of agricultural land still dependent on rain-fed sources. Although
Syria has sufficient water supplies in the aggregate at normal levels
of precipitation, the great distance between major water supplies and
population centers poses serious distribution problems, and the water
problem is exacerbated by rapid population growth, industrial
expansion, and increased water pollution. Unemployment remains a
nagging problem because about 60% of the population is under the age
of 20, ensuring a steady flow of job seekers into the already tight
labor market. Private investment is critical to the modernization of
the agricultural, energy, and export sectors, particularly because
Damascus is saddled with a heavy foreign debt. Oil production is
leveling off, and the efforts of the nonoil sector to penetrate
international markets have fallen short. Syria's inadequate
infrastructure, outmoded technological base, and weak educational
system hamper competition with neighbors such as Jordan and Israel.
The dominant public sector continues to be plagued by labor,
financial, and management problems, and much of the private sector is
hobbled by a shortage of capital. The economic benefits of any peace
treaty with Israel will depend in large part on the pace of economic
reform.

TAJIKISTAN

Introduction

Current issues: Tajikistan has experienced three changes of government
since it gained independence in September 1991. The current president,
Emomali RAHMONOV, was elected in November 1994, yet has been in power
since 1992. The country is suffering through its fourth year of a
civil conflict, with no clear end in sight. Underlying the conflict
are deeply rooted regional and clan-based animosities that pit a
government consisting of people primarily from the Kulob (Kulyab),
Khujand (Leninabad), and Hisor (Hissar) regions against a secular and
Islamic-led opposition from the Gharm, Gorno-Badakhshan, and
Qurghonteppa (Kurgan-Tyube) regions. Government and opposition
representatives have held periodic rounds of UN-mediated peace talks
and agreed in September 1994 to a cease-fire which has been
periodically extended. Russian-led peacekeeping troops are deployed
throughout the country, and Russian-commanded border guards are
stationed along the Tajikistani-Afghan border.
