Economy

Economy - overview: This is a well-to-do oil-based economy with strong
government controls over major economic activities. About 40% of GDP
comes from the private sector. Economic (as well as political) ties
with the US are especially strong. The petroleum sector accounts for
roughly 75% of budget revenues, 35% of GDP, and 90% of export
earnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves of petroleum in the
world (26% of the proved total), ranks as the largest exporter of
petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the
government intends to bring its budget, which has been in deficit
since 1983, back into balance, and to encourage private economic
activity. Roughly four million foreign workers play an important role
in the Saudi economy, for example, in the oil and service sectors. For
over a decade, Saudi Arabia's domestic and international outlays have
outstripped its income, and the government has cut its foreign
assistance and is beginning to rein in domestic programs. A
substantial rise in oil prices was the key to a successful 1996. For
1997, the country looks to its policies of maintaining moderate fiscal
reforms, restraining public spending, and encouraging non-oil exports.

Economy

Economy - overview: In 1994 Senegal embarked on its most concerted
structural adjustment effort yet to exploit the 50% devaluation of the
currencies of the 14 Francophone African nations which took place on
12 January of that year. After years of foot-dragging, the government
passed a liberalized labor code which should lower the cost of labor
and improve the manufacturing sector's competitiveness. Inroads also
have been made in closing tax loopholes, eliminating monopoly power in
several sectors, and privatizing state-owned firms. At the same time,
the government is holding the line on current fiscal expenditure under
the watchful eyes of international organizations on which it depends
for substantial support. The IMF, in mid-1995, announced that the
government met most economic targets as called for in its Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility agreement and released the second $50
million tranche. The country's narrow tax and resource base,
environmental degradation, and untamed growth of the population will
continue to hold back improvement in living standards over the medium
term. According to the draft budget, GDP will again rise by 5% in
1997.

Introduction

Current issues: Serbia and Montenegro have asserted the formation of a
joint independent state, but this entity has not been formally
recognized as a state by the US; the US view is that the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) has dissolved and that none of
the successor republics represents its continuation.

Economy

Economy - overview: The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation in
1991 has been followed by highly destructive warfare, the
destabilization of republic boundaries, and the breakup of important
interrepublic trade flows. Output in Serbia and Montenegro dropped by
half in 1992-93. Like the other former Yugoslav republics, it had
depended on its sister republics for large amounts of energy and
manufactures. Wide differences in climate, mineral resources, and
levels of technology among the republics accentuated this
interdependence, as did the communist practice of concentrating much
industrial output in a small number of giant plants. The breakup of
many of the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial plants
lost suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical assets in
the fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the
republics. One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia and
Montenegro is the continuation in office of a communist government
that is primarily interested in political and military mastery, not
economic reform. Hyperinflation ended with the establishment of a new
currency unit in June 1993; prices were relatively stable in 1995.
Reliable statistics are hard to come by; the GDP estimate is extremely
rough. The economic boom anticipated by the government after the
suspension of UN sanctions in December 1995 failed to materialize in
1996 and early 1997, exacerbating the regime's financial problems.

Economy

Economy - overview: Since independence in 1976, per capita output in
this Indian Ocean archipelago has grown to roughly seven times the old
near-subsistence level, led by the tourist sector, which employs about
30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of hard currency
earnings. In recent years the government has encouraged foreign
investment in order to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same
time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by
promoting the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale
manufacturing. The vulnerability of the tourist sector was illustrated
by the sharp drop in 1991-92 due largely to the Gulf war. Although the
industry has rebounded, the government recognizes the continuing need
for upgrading the sector in the face of stiff international
competition.

Economy

Economy - overview: Sierra Leone has substantial mineral,
agricultural, and fishery resources. However, the economic and social
infrastructure is not well developed, and serious social disorders
continue to hamper economic development. Agriculture employs about
two-thirds of the working population, with subsistence agriculture
dominating the sector. Manufacturing consists mainly of the processing
of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market.
The mining of diamonds, bauxite, and rutile is the major source of
hard currency. The government has worked hard to meet its IMF- and
World Bank-mandated stabilization targets, holding down fiscal
deficits and retiring much of its domestic debt, but at a steep cost
in terms of forgone capital investments and social spending. Moreover,
the economic infrastructure has nearly collapsed due to neglect and
war-related disruptions in the mining and agricultural export sectors.
The continuing civil war in Liberia has led to a large influx of
refugees, who place additional burdens on Sierra Leone's fragile
economy.

Economy

Economy - overview: Singapore has an open economy with strong service
and manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading links
derived from its entrepot history. A slump in global demand for
electronics slowed Singapore's export growth in 1996, and as a result,
real GDP grew 6.5%, down from 8.9% in 1995. The government predicts
growth will be in the 5%-7% range in 1997. Rising labor costs continue
to be a threat to Singapore's competitiveness, and the government's
strategy to address this problem includes increasing productivity,
improving infrastructure, and encouraging higher value-added
industries. In applied technology, per capita output, investment, and
labor discipline, Singapore has key attributes of a developed country.
