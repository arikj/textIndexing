Economy

Economy - overview: The economy of Western Samoa has traditionally
been dependent on development aid, private family remittances from
overseas, and agricultural exports. Increasingly, tourism is becoming
a significant source of revenue, earning approximately $34 million in
1995. While registering an overall economic improvement in 1995,
however, the country continues to struggle with a series of natural
disasters from the early 1990s which wiped out the nation's
infrastructure as well as its then-major export crop, taro root.
Agriculture continues to be a key source of wealth for Apia, employing
more than one-half of the labor force, and furnishing 90% of exports.
The bulk of these export earnings comes from the sale of coconut
cream, coconut oil, and copra. Family remittances also play a key role
in economic viability for the island nation - in 1995, remittances
totaled $34.9 million, four times export earnings. The economy did
well in 1996, supported by a steady flow of foreign aid and
remittances.

Economy

Economy - overview: Real global output - gross world product (GWP) -
rose an estimated 3.6% in 1996, with the newly industrializing Third
World countries again setting the pace. And once more, results varied
widely among regions and countries. Average growth of 2.3% in the GDP
of industrialized countries (55% of GWP in 1996) and average growth of
6.5% in the GDP of less developed countries (39% of GWP) were partly
offset by a 2% drop in the GDP of the former USSR/Eastern Europe area
(only 6% of GWP). With the notable exception of Japan at 3%,
unemployment was typically 6%-12% in the industrial world. The US
accounted for 21% of GWP in 1996; Western Europe accounted for 20%;
and Japan accounted for 8%. These are the three "economic superpowers"
presumably destined to compete for mastery in international markets on
into the 21st century. As for the less developed countries: China,
India, and the Four Dragons - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
Singapore - once again posted records of 5% growth or better; however,
many other countries, especially in Africa, continued to suffer from
drought, rapid population growth, inflation, and civil strife. Central
Europe and the 15 successor states to the USSR generally made progress
in moving toward "market-friendly" economies, but output in Russia and
Ukraine continued to fall. Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock
economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over
international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.
Internally, the central government in a number of cases is losing
control over resources as separatist regional movements - typically
based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of
the former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, in India, and in
Canada. In Western Europe, governments face the difficult political
problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to
increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The
addition of nearly 100 million people each year to an already
overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of pollution,
desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of
their own internal problems, the industrialized countries have
inadequate resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the
world, which, at least from the economic point of view, are becoming
further marginalized. (For specific economic developments in each
country, see the individual country entries.)

Economy

Economy - overview: The northern city Sanaa is the political capital
of a united Yemen, and the southern city Aden, with its refinery and
port facilities, is the economic and commercial capital. Future
economic development depends heavily on Western-assisted development
of the country's moderate oil resources. Former South Yemen's
willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet
economic support. The low level of domestic industry and agriculture
has made northern Yemen dependent on imports for practically all of
its essential needs. Once self-sufficient in food production, northern
Yemen has become a major importer. Land once used for export crops -
cotton, fruit, and vegetables - has been turned over to growing a
shrub called qat, whose leaves are chewed for their stimulant effect
by Yemenis and which has no significant export market. Economic growth
in former South Yemen has been constrained by a lack of incentives,
partly stemming from centralized control over production decisions,
investment allocation, and import choices. Yemen's GDP has been
supplemented by remittances from Yemenis working abroad and by foreign
aid. Since the Gulf crisis, however, remittances have dropped
substantially. Floods in June 1996 caused the loss of much valuable
topsoil in the agricultural sector, increasing the need for imports of

Economy

Economy - overview: Despite progress in privatization and budgetary
reform, Zambia's economy has a long way to go. Inflation, while
slowing somewhat, continues to be a major concern to the CHILUBA
government. Zambia's copper mining sector, which accounts for over 80%
of the nation's foreign currency intake, is struggling. Production
rates are down as are world copper prices. Aid cuts by Zambia's
donors, arising out of concern for the November 1996 flawed election,
will severely damage Zambia's economic prospects. Urged by the World
Bank, Zambia has embarked on a privatization program which is to
include the all-important copper industry.

Economy

Economy - overview: Agriculture employs 70% of the labor force of this
landlocked nation and supplies almost 40% of exports. Mining accounts
for only 5% of both GDP and employment, but minerals and metals
account for about 40% of exports. Severe drought caused GDP to drop 8%
in 1992, with growth rebounding to 2% in 1993 and 4.5% in 1994, only
to drop by 2.4% in 1995. The government is continuing to push its
IMF/World Bank structural adjustment program aimed at encouraging
exports and foreign investment. Officials face the difficult task of
restraining expenditures in their effort to keep inflation within
bounds.

Economy

Economy - overview: Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with
considerable guidance of investment and foreign trade by government
officials and partial government ownership of some large banks and
industrial firms. Real growth in GDP has averaged about 9% a year
during the past three decades. Export growth has been even faster and
has provided the impetus for industrialization. Inflation and
unemployment are low. Agriculture contributes less than 4% to GDP,
down from 35% in 1952. Traditional labor-intensive industries are
steadily being moved off-shore and replaced with more capital- and
technology-intensive industries. Taiwan has become a major investor in
China, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
The tightening of labor markets has led to an influx of foreign
workers, both legal and illegal.
