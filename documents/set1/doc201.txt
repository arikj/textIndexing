Economy

Economy - overview: The US has the most powerful, diverse, and
technologically advanced economy in the world, with a per capita GDP
of $28,600, the largest among major industrial nations. In this
market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make
most of the decisions, and government buys needed goods and services
predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms enjoy
considerably greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western
Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, lay off surplus
workers, and develop new products. At the same time, they face higher
barriers to entry in their rivals' home markets than the barriers to
entry of foreign firms in US markets. In all economic sectors, US
firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances,
especially in computers, and medical, aerospace, and military
equipment, although their advantage has narrowed since the end of
World War II. The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual
development of a "two-tier labor market" in which those at the bottom
lack the education and the professional/technical skills of those at
the top and, more and more, fail to get pay raises, health insurance
coverage, and other benefits. The years 1994-96 witnessed moderate
gains in real output, low inflation rates, and a drop in unemployment
below 6%. Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic
infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs of an aging population,
sizable budget and trade deficits, and stagnation of family income in
the lower economic groups. The outlook for 1997 is for continued
moderate growth, low inflation, and about the same level of
unemployment.

Economy

Economy - overview: Uruguay's small economy benefits from a favorable
climate for agriculture and substantial hydropower potential. Economic
development has been restrained in recent years by high - though
declining - inflation and extensive government regulation. The
SANGUINETTI government's conservative monetary and fiscal policies are
aimed at continuing to reduce inflation, at 24.3% at yearend 1996;
other priorities include extensive reform of the social security
system and increased investment in education. Uruguay recovered from
recession in 1996 - partly due to the recovery in Argentina - and
ended the year with a nearly 5% rise in GDP. Uruguayan trade continued
to expand and the potential for new markets continued to open through
the negotiations of Mercosur (Southern Cone Common Market) with
neighboring countries and the European Union (EU). The economy is
expected to continue growing at a healthy rate in 1997 along with
other regional economies.

Economy

Economy - overview: Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country of which
10% consists of intensely cultivated, irrigated river valleys. It was
one of the poorest areas of the former Soviet Union with more than 60%
of its population living in overpopulated rural communities.
Uzbekistan is now the world's third largest cotton exporter, a major
producer of gold and natural gas, and a regionally significant
producer of chemicals and machinery. Following independence in
December 1991, the government sought to prop up its Soviet-style
command economy with subsidies and tight controls on production and
prices. Faced with high rates of inflation, however, the government
stepped up the pace of reform in mid-1994, by introducing tighter
monetary policies, expanding privatization, slightly reducing the role
of the state in the economy, and improving the environment for foreign
investors. Nevertheless, the state continues to be a dominating
influence in the economy, and reforms have so far failed to bring
about much-needed structural changes. The IMF suspended Uzbekistan's
$185 million standby arrangement in late 1996 because of governmental
steps that made impossible fulfillment of Fund conditions.

Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based primarily on subsistence or
small-scale agriculture which provides a living for 65% of the
population. Fishing and tourism are the other mainstays of the
economy, with 43,000 visitors in 1992. Mineral deposits are
negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light
industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly
from import duties. Economic development is hindered by dependence on
relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters,
and long distances from main markets and between constituent islands.

Economy

Economy - overview: The petroleum sector dominates the economy,
accounting for roughly 25% of GDP, 70% of export earnings, and 50% of
central government revenues. It is likely to become even more
important as the state petroleum company plans to double its
production over the next ten years. The non-petroleum sectors have
been contracting, however, with GDP shrinking by 1.6% during 1996.
Realizing the failure of interventionist policies, the CALDERA
administration embarked on a comprehensive reform program and
successfully negotiated a $1.4 billion stand-by agreement with the
IMF. The state eliminated price and exchange controls, reduced the
long-standing subsidy on gasoline, and revitalized its stalled
privatization program. Foreign investors reacted positively and the
Caracas stock exchange ended 1996 as the world's best performing stock
market. The influx of foreign investment and a windfall of oil
revenues resulting from higher-than-expected international oil prices
raised Venezuela's reserves to over $15 billion. As a result,
Venezuela used only the first tranche of the IMF credit - $400
million. The currency depreciated sharply following the exchange
liberalization, and caused an inflationary burst that led to a 103%
yearly rate of inflation, the highest in Venezuelan history. The
bolivar has since strengthened and inflation fell near the end of the
year. The macroeconomic adjustments should take hold in 1997, and the
economy is expected to grow by 4% or more. Increased salary demands by
public and private sector workers, however, threaten a renewal of
inflationary pressures.
