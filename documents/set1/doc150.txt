 agriculture and mining, produces a variety of goods and contributes
 35% to GDP. Mining accounts for only 5% of both GDP and employment,
 but minerals and metals account for about 40% of exports. Severe
 drought caused GDP to drop 8% in 1992, with growth rebounding to 2% in
 1993 and 3.5% in 1994. Despite the lingering effects of the drought on
 economic and social conditions, the government is continuing to push

APPENDIX C

International Organizations and Groups

 Note: The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) has
 dissolved and ceases to exist. None of the successor states of the
 former Yugoslavia, including Serbia and Montenegro, have been
 permitted to participate solely on the basis of the membership of the
 former Yugoslavia in the United Nations General Assembly and Economic
 and Social Council and their subsidiary bodies and in various United
 Nations specialized agencies. The United Nations, however, permits the
 seat and nameplate of the SFRY to remain, permits the SFRY mission to
 continue to function, and continues to fly the flag of the former
 Yugoslavia. For a variety of reasons, a number of other organizations
 have not yet taken action with regard to the membership of the former
 Yugoslavia. The World Factbook therefore continues to list Yugoslavia
 under international organizations where the SFRY seat remains or where
 no action has yet been taken.
