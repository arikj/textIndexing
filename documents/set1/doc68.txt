@Belgium, Economy

Overview: 
  This small private enterprise economy has capitalized on its central
  geographic location, highly developed transport network, and
  diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated
  mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north, although the
  government is encouraging reinvestment in the southern region of
  Walloon. With few natural resources Belgium must import substantial
  quantities of raw materials and export a large volume of manufactures,
  making its economy unusually dependent on the state of world markets.
  Three fourths of its trade is with other EC countries. The economy
  grew at a strong 4% pace during the period 1988-90, but economic
  growth slowed to a 1% pace in 1991-92 and dropped by 1.5% in 1993.
  Belgium's public debt has risen to 140% of GDP, and the government is
  trying to control its expenditures to bring the figure more into line
  with other industrialized countries.

@Benin, Economy

Overview: 
  Benin is one of the least developed countries in the world because of
  limited natural resources and a poorly developed infrastructure.
  Agriculture accounts for about 35% of GDP, employs about 60% of the
  labor force, and generates a major share of foreign exchange earnings.
  The industrial sector contributes only about 10% to GDP and employs 2%
  of the work force. Low prices in recent years have kept down hard
  currency earnings from Benin's major exports of agricultural products,
  primarily cotton. A World Bank supported structural adjustment program
  begun in 1989 has helped strengthen the economy through such measures
  as trimming the government payroll, reforming the tax system, and
  encouraging private investment, both domestic and foreign. Benin has
  experienced 3 consecutive years of moderate growth as a result.

@Bhutan, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy, one of the world's least developed, is based on
  agriculture and forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90% of
  the population and account for about 50% of GDP. Rugged mountains
  dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other
  infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned
  with that of India through strong trade and monetary links. The
  industrial sector is small and technologically backward, with most
  production of the cottage industry type. Most development projects,
  such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's
  hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are its most
  important natural resources; however, the government limits the number
  of tourists to 4,000 per year to minimize foreign influence. Much of
  the impetus for growth has come from large public-sector companies.
  Nevertheless, in recent years, Bhutan has shifted toward decentralized
  development planning and greater private initiative. The government
  privatized several large public-sector firms, is revamping its trade

@Bolivia, Economy

Overview: 
  With its long history of semifeudal social controls, dependence on
  volatile prices for its mineral exports, and bouts of hyperinflation,
  Bolivia has remained one of the poorest and least developed Latin
  American countries. However, Bolivia has experienced generally
  improving economic conditions since the PAZ Estenssoro administration
  (1985-89) introduced market-oriented policies which reduced inflation
  from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in 1988. PAZ Estenssoro was followed
  as President by Jaime PAZ Zamora (1989-93) who continued the
  free-market policies of his predecessor, despite opposition from his
  own party and from Bolivia's once powerful labor movement. By
  maintaining fiscal discipline, PAZ Zamora helped reduce inflation to
  9.3% in 1993, while GDP grew by an annual average of 3.25% during his
  tenure. Inaugurated in August 1993, President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA has
  vowed to advance government market-oriented economic reforms he helped
  launch as PAZ Estenssoro's Planning Minister. A major privatization
  bill was passed by the Bolivian legislature in late March 1994.

@Bosnia and Herzegovina

Header
Note: 
  Bosnia and Herzegovina is suffering from interethnic civil strife
  which began in March 1992 after the Government of Bosnia and
  Herzegovina held a referendum on independence. Bosnia's Serbs -
  supported by neighboring Serbia - responded with armed resistance
  aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and joining
  Serb-held areas to a "greater Serbia." Since the onset of the
  conflict, which has driven approximately half of the pre-war
  population of 4.4 million from their homes, both the Bosnian Serbs and
  the Bosnian Croats have asserted control of more than three-quarters
  of the territory formerly under the control of the Government of
  Bosnia and Herzegovina. The UN and the EU are continuing to try to
  mediate a plan for peace. In March 1994 Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian
  Croats signed an agreement in Washington, DC, creating a Federation of
  Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is to include territories in which
  Muslims or Croats predominated, according to the 1991 census. Bosnian
  Serbs refused to become a part of this Federation.
