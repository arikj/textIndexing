@Man, Isle Of:Economy

 Overview: Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors
 of the economy. The government's policy of offering incentives to
 high-technology companies and financial institutions to locate on the
 island has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in
 high-income industries. As a result, agriculture and fishing, once the
 mainstays of the economy, have declined in their shares of GDP.
 Banking now contributes about 45% to GDP. Trade is mostly with the UK.
 The Isle of Man enjoys free access to European Union markets.

 about 70% of the budget.

@Martinique:Economy

 Overview: The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism, and
 light industry. Agriculture accounts for about 10% of GDP and the
 small industrial sector for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with
 most of the sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana
 exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk of meat,
 vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported, contributing to a
 chronic trade deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from
 France. Tourism has become more important than agricultural exports as
 a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the work force is
 employed in the service sector and in administration. Banana workers
 launched protests late in 1992 because of falling banana prices and
 fears of greater competition in the European market from other
 producers.

@Mauritania:Economy

 Overview: A majority of the population still depends on agriculture
 and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and
 many subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent
 droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania has extensive deposits of
 iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports. The decline
 in world demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks in
 production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing
 areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this
 key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near
 Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, drought and economic
 mismanagement have resulted in a substantial buildup of foreign debt.
 The government has begun the second stage of an economic reform
 program in consultation with the World Bank, the IMF, and major donor
 countries. Short-term growth prospects are gloomy because of the heavy
 debt service burden, rapid population growth, and vulnerability to
 climatic conditions.

@Mauritius:Economy

 Overview: Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed from a
 low income, agriculturally based economy to middle income diversified
 economy with growing industrial and tourist sectors. For most of the
 period annual growth has been of the order of 5% to 6%. This
 remarkable achievement has been reflected in increased life
 expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much improved
 infrastructure. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land
 area and accounts for 40% of export earnings. The government's
 development strategy centers on industrialization (with a view to
 modernization and to exports), agricultural diversification, and
 tourism. Economic performance in 1991-93 continued strong with solid
 real growth and low unemployment.

 of the island are heavily dependent on French financial assistance.

@Mexico:Economy

 Overview: Mexico, under the guidance of new President Ernesto ZEDILLO,
 entered 1995 in the midst of a severe financial crisis. Mexico's
 membership in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the
 United States and Canada, its solid record of economic reforms, and
 its strong growth in the second and third quarters of 1994 - at an
 annual rate of 3.8% and 4.5% respectively - seemed to augur bright
 prospects for 1995. However, an overvalued exchange rate and widening
 current account deficits created an imbalance that ultimately proved
 unsustainable. To finance the trade gap, Mexico City had become
 increasingly reliant on volatile portfolio investment. A series of
 political shocks in 1994 - an uprising in the southern state of
 Chiapas, the assassination of a presidential candidate, several high
 profile kidnappings, the killing of a second high-level political
 figure, and renewed threats from the Chiapas rebels - combined with
 rising international interest rates and concerns of a devaluation to
 undermine investor confidence and prompt massive outflows of capital.
 The dwindling of foreign exchange reserves, which the central bank had
 been using to defend the currency, forced the new administration to
 change the exchange rate policy and allow the currency to float freely
 in the last days of 1994. The adjustment roiled Mexican financial
 markets, leading to a 30% to 40% weakening of the peso relative to the
 dollar. ZEDILLO announced an emergency economic program that included
 federal budget cuts and plans for more privatizations, but it failed
 to restore investor confidence quickly. While the devaluation is
 likely to help Mexican exporters, whose products are now cheaper, it
 also raises the specter of an inflationary spiral if domestic
 producers increase their prices and workers demand wage hikes.
 Although strong economic fundamentals bode well for Mexico's
 longer-term outlook, prospects for solid growth and low inflation have
 deteriorated considerably, at least through 1995.
