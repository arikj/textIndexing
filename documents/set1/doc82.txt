International disputes: 
  Iran and Iraq restored diplomatic relations in 1990 but are still
  trying to work out written agreements settling outstanding disputes
  from their eight-year war concerning border demarcation,
  prisoners-of-war, and freedom of navigation and sovereignty over the
  Shatt al Arab waterway; in April 1991 official Iraqi acceptance of UN
  Security Council Resolution 687, which demands that Iraq accept the
  inviolability of the boundary set forth in its 1963 agreement with
  Kuwait, ending earlier claims to Bubiyan and Warbah islands or to all
  of Kuwait; the 20 May 1993 final report of the UN Iraq/Kuwait Boundary
  Demarcation Commission was welcomed by the Security Council in
  Resolution 833 of 27 May 1993, which also reaffirmed that the
  decisions of the commission on the boundary were final, bringing to a
  completion the official demarcation of the Iraq-Kuwait boundary; Iraqi
  officials still refuse to unconditionally recognize Kuwaiti
  sovereignty or the inviolability of the UN demarcated border; periodic
  disputes with upstream riparian Syria over Euphrates water rights;
  potential dispute over water development plans by Turkey for the
  Tigris and Euphrates Rivers
Climate: 
  mostly desert; mild to cool winters with dry, hot, cloudless summers;

  winters with occasionally heavy snows

Environment: 
current issues: 
  government water control projects drain inhabited marsh areas, drying
  up or diverting the streams and rivers that support a sizable
  population of Shi'a Muslims who have inhabited these areas for
  thousands of years; the destruction of the natural habitat also poses
  serious threats to the wildlife populations; damage to water treatment
  and sewage facilities during Gulf war; inadequate supplies of potable
  water; development of Tigris-Euphrates Rivers system contingent upon
  agreements with upstream riparians (Syria, Turkey); air and water
  pollution; soil degradation (salinization) and erosion;
  desertification

@Iraq, Economy

Overview: 
  The Ba'thist regime engages in extensive central planning and
  management of industrial production and foreign trade while leaving
  some small-scale industry and services and most agriculture to private
  enterprise. The economy has been dominated by the oil sector, which
  has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. In
  the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive expenditures in the
  eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran,
  led the government to implement austerity measures and to borrow
  heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments. After the end of
  hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with the
  construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities.
  Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages,
  salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land reform and
  collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although accorded
  high priority by the government, also was under financial constraints.
  Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international
  economic embargoes, and military action by an international coalition
  beginning in January 1991 drastically changed the economic picture.
  Industrial and transportation facilities suffered severe damage and
  have been only partially restored. Oil exports remain at less than 10%
  of the previous level. Shortages of spare parts continue. Living
  standards deteriorated even further in 1993 and early 1994; consumer
  prices at least tripled in 1993. The UN-sponsored economic embargo has
  reduced exports and imports and has contributed to the sharp rise in
  prices. The government's policies of supporting large military and
  internal security forces and of allocating resources to key supporters
  of the regime have exacerbated shortages. In brief, per capita output
  in 1993-94 is far below the 1989-90 level, but no precise estimate is
  available.

@Ireland, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy is small and trade dependent. Agriculture, once the most
  important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts for 37%
  of GDP, about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor force.
  Since 1987, real GDP growth, led by exports, has averaged 4% annually.
  Over the same period, inflation has fallen sharply and chronic trade
  deficits have been transformed into annual surpluses. Unemployment
  remains a serious problem, however, and job creation is the main focus
  of government policy. To ease unemployment, Dublin aggressively courts
  foreign investors and recently created a new industrial development
  agency to aid small indigenous firms. Government assistance is
  constrained by Dublin's continuing deficit reduction measures.

@Israel, Economy

Overview: 
  Israel has a market economy with substantial government participation.
  It depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and
  military equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has
  intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the
  past 20 years. Industry employs about 22% of Israeli workers,
  construction 6.5%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 3.5%, and
  services most of the rest. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and
  agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are leading exports.
  Israel usually posts current account deficits, which are covered by
  large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half
  of the government's external debt is owed to the United States, which
  is its major source of economic and military aid. To earn needed
  foreign exchange, Israel has been targeting high-technology niches in
  international markets, such as medical scanning equipment. The influx
  of Jewish immigrants from the former USSR, which topped 450,000 during
  the period 1990-93, increased unemployment, intensified housing
  problems, and strained the government budget. At the same time, the
  immigrants bring to the economy valuable scientific and professional
  expertise. Economic problems have eased as immigration has declined,
  but activity has slowed as the economy shifts from housing to
  export-driven growth.

@Italy, Economy

Overview: 
  Since World War II the Italian economy has changed from one based on
  agriculture into a ranking industrial economy, with approximately the
  same total and per capita output as France and the UK. The country is
  still divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private
  companies, and an undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by large
  public enterprises. Services account for 48% of GDP, industry 35%,
  agriculture 4%, and public administration 13%. Most raw materials
  needed by industry and over 75% of energy requirements must be
  imported. After growing at an annual average rate of 3% in 1983-90,
  growth slowed to about 1% in 1991 and 1992 and fell by 0.7% in 1993.
  In the second half of 1992, Rome became unsettled by the prospect of
  not qualifying to participate in EC plans for economic and monetary
  union later in the decade; thus it finally began to address its huge
  fiscal imbalances. Thanks to the determination of Prime Ministers
  AMATO and CIAMPI, the government adopted a fairly stringent budget for
  1993 and 1994, abandoned its highly inflationary wage indexation
  system, and started to scale back its extremely generous social
  welfare programs, including pension and health care benefits. Monetary
  officials were forced to withdraw the lira from the European monetary
  system in September 1992 when it came under extreme pressure in
  currency markets. For the 1990s, Italy faces the problems of
  refurbishing a tottering communications system, curbing pollution in
  major industrial centers, and adjusting to the new competitive forces
  accompanying the ongoing economic integration of the European Union.

@Jamaica, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy is based on sugar, bauxite, and tourism. In September
  1988, Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on crops and the
  electric power system, a sharp but temporary setback to the economy.
  By October 1989 the economic recovery from the hurricane was largely
  complete, and real growth was up to about 3% for 1989. In 1991,
  however, growth dropped to 0.2% as a result of the US recession, lower
  world bauxite prices, and monetary instability. In 1992, growth was
  1.2%, supported by a recovery in tourism and stabilization of the
  Jamaican dollar in the second half of 1992.
