@Cape Verde:Economy

 Overview: Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural
 resource base, serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of
 long-term drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service
 oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for
 60% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural
 areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 20%; the fishing sector
 accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing
 potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. Cape Verde
 annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances from
 emigrants and foreign aid, which form important supplements to GDP.
 Economic reforms, launched by the new democratic government in 1991,
 are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting foreign
 investment to diversify the economy. Prospects for 1995 depend heavily
 on the maintenance of aid flows, remittances, and the momentum of the
 government's development program.

@Central African Republic:Economy

 Overview: Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry, remains the
 backbone of the CAR economy, with more than 70% of the population
 living in outlying areas. The agricultural sector generates about half
 of GDP. Timber has accounted for about 26% of export earnings and the
 diamond industry for 54%. Important constraints to economic
 development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor
 transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy of
 misdirected macroeconomic policies. A major plus is the large forest
 reserves, which the government is moving to protect from
 overexploitation. The 50% devaluation of the currencies of 14
 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had mixed effects on
 CAR's economy. While diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton exports
 increased - leading GDP to increase by 5.5% - inflation rose to 40%,
 fueled by the rising prices of imports on which the economy depends.
 CAR's poor resource base and primitive infrastructure will keep it
 dependent on multilateral donors and France for the foreseeable
 future.

@Chad:Economy

 Overview: Climate, geographic remoteness, poor resource endowment, and
 lack of infrastructure make Chad one of the most underdeveloped
 countries in the world. Its economy is hobbled by political turmoil,
 conflict with Libya, drought, and food shortages. Consequently the
 economy has shown little progress in recent years in overcoming a
 severe setback brought on by civil war in the late 1980s. More than
 80% of the work force is involved in subsistence farming and fishing.
 Cotton is the major cash crop, accounting for at least half of
 exports. Chad is highly dependent on foreign aid, especially food
 credits, given chronic shortages in several regions. Of all the
 Francophone countries in Africa, Chad has benefited the least from the
 50% devaluation of their currencies on 12 January 1994. Despite an
 increase in external financial aid and favorable price increases for
 cotton - the primary source of foreign exchange - the corrupt and
 enfeebled government bureaucracy continues to dampen economic
 enterprise by neglecting payments to domestic suppliers and public
 sector salaries. Oil production in the Lake Chad area remains a
 distant prospect and the subsistence-driven economy probably will
 continue to limp along in the near term.

@Chile:Economy

 Overview: Chile has a prosperous, essentially free market economy,
 with the degree of government intervention varying according to the
 philosophy of the different regimes. Under the center-left government
 of President AYLWIN, which took power in March 1990, spending on
 social welfare rose steadily. At the same time business investment,
 exports, and consumer spending also grew substantially. The new
 president, FREI, who took office in March 1994, has emphasized social
 spending even more. Growth in 1991-94 has averaged 6.5% annually, with
 an estimated one million Chileans having moved out of poverty in the
 last four years. Copper remains vital to the health of the economy;
 Chile is the world's largest producer and exporter of copper. Success
 in meeting the government's goal of sustained annual growth of 5%
 depends on world copper prices, the level of confidence of foreign
 investors and creditors, and the government's own ability to maintain
 a conservative fiscal stance.

@China:Economy

 Overview: Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been
 trying to move the economy from the sluggish Soviet-style centrally
 planned economy to a more productive and flexible economy with market
 elements, but still within the framework of monolithic Communist
 control. To this end the authorities switched to a system of household
 responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization,
 increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in
 industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in
 services and light manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased
 foreign trade and investment. The result has been a strong surge in
 production, particularly in agriculture in the early 1980s. Industry
 also has posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong
 Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and modern
 production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and
 export goods. Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On
 the darker side, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid
 system the worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude,
 corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up
 inflation). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked, retightening
 central controls at intervals. In 1992-94 annual growth of GDP
 accelerated, particularly in the coastal areas - to more than 10%
 annually according to official claims. In late 1993 China's leadership
 approved additional long-term reforms aimed at giving more play to
 market-oriented institutions and at strengthening the center's control
 over the financial system. In 1994 strong growth continued in the
 widening market-oriented areas of the economy. At the same time, the
 government struggled to (a) collect revenues due from provinces,
 businesses, and individuals; (b) keep inflation within bounds; (c)
 reduce extortion and other economic crimes; and (d) keep afloat the
 large state-owned enterprises, most of which had not participated in
 the vigorous expansion of the economy. From 60 to 100 million surplus
 rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities, many
 barely subsisting through part-time low-pay jobs. Popular resistance,
 changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres have
 weakened China's population control program, which is essential to the
 nation's long-term economic viability. One of the most dangerous
 long-term threats to continued rapid economic growth is the
 deterioration in the environment, notably air pollution, soil erosion,
 and the steady fall of the water table especially in the north.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $2.9788 trillion
 (1994 estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992 by

 the result may overstate China's GDP by as much as 25%)
