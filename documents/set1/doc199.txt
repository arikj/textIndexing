Economy

Economy - overview: Trinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation as an
excellent investment site for international businesses. Successful
economic reforms implemented in 1995 are expected to bring an average
growth rate of 2% over the next three years, and foreign investment
and trade are flourishing. Unemployment - a main cause of the
country's socio-economic problems - is high, but has decreased to its
lowest point in five years. The country enjoys a healthy trade surplus
of $500 million, yet its heavy dependence on oil and petrochemical
prices makes its trade balance vulnerable to sudden shifts.
Furthermore, Caricom, Trinidad and Tobago's main market, is saturated,
provoking some countries to establish non-tariff trade barriers.

Economy

Economy - overview: Tunisia has a diverse economy, with important
agricultural, mining, energy, tourism, and manufacturing sectors.
Detailed governmental control of economic affairs has gradually
lessened over the past decade with increasing privatization of trade
and commerce, simplification of the tax structure, and a cautious
approach to debt. Real growth has averaged 4.5% in 1991-96, and
inflation has been moderate. Growth in tourism and increased trade
have been key elements in this solid record. Agricultural production
accounted for a major portion of growth in GDP in 1996, growth having
been adversely affected by drought in 1995. Further privatization, the
attraction of increased foreign investment, and improvements in
government efficiency are among the challenges for the future.

Economy

Economy - overview: Turkey's dynamic economy is a complex mix of
modern industry and commerce along with traditional village
agriculture and crafts. The economy has a strong and rapidly growing
private sector, yet the state still plays a major role in basic
industry, banking, transport, and communication. The current economic
situation is marked by strong growth coupled with worsening
imbalances. Real GDP expanded by about 7% in 1996 but inflation rose
to 80%, the current account deficit reached about 3% of GDP, and the
public sector fiscal deficit probably topped 10% of GDP, leading to
speculation that the country could be headed toward a repeat of its
1994 financial crisis. To some extent, Ankara is caught in a vicious
circle because half of all central government revenue in 1996 went to
pay interest on the national debt. The government that took office in
July 1996 - an unusual coalition of Prime Minister ERBAKAN's Islamic
Welfare Party and Deputy Prime Minister CILLER's conservative True
Path Party - is trying to solve the fiscal problem by greatly
accelerating Turkey's privatization program. It has proposed a
balanced budget for 1997, although this is widely regarded as over
optimistic because it is based on earning more privatization revenue
in one year than Turkey has earned over the last decade. Ankara is
trying to increase trade with other countries in the region but most
of Turkey's trade is still with OECD countries. Despite the
implementation in January 1996 of a customs union with the EU, foreign
direct investment in the country totaled only about half a billion
dollars, perhaps because potential investors were concerned about the
prospects for economic stability.

Economy

Economy - overview: Turkmenistan is largely desert country with
nomadic cattle raising, intensive agriculture in irrigated oases, and
huge gas and oil resources. One-half of its irrigated land is planted
in cotton, making it the world's tenth largest producer. It also
possesses the world's fifth largest reserves of natural gas and
substantial oil resources. Until the end of 1993, Turkmenistan had
experienced less economic disruption than other former Soviet states
because its economy received a boost from higher prices for oil and
gas and a sharp increase in hard currency earnings. In 1994, Russia's
refusal to export Turkmen gas to hard currency markets and mounting
debts of its major customers in the former USSR for gas deliveries
contributed to a sharp fall in industrial production and caused the
budget to shift from a surplus to a slight deficit. The economy
recovered slightly in 1996, but high inflation continued. Furthermore,
with an authoritarian ex-communist regime in power and a tribally
based social structure, Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to
economic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton sales to sustain its
inefficient economy. In 1996, the government set in place a
stabilization program aimed at a unified and market-based exchange
rate, allocation of government credits by auction, and strict limits
on budget deficits. Privatization goals remain limited. Turkmenistan
is working hard to open new gas export channels through Iran and
Turkey to Europe, but these will take many years to realize.

Economy

Economy - overview: The Turks and Caicos economy is based on tourism,
fishing, and offshore financial services. Most food for domestic
consumption is imported; there is some subsistence farming - mainly
corn, cassava, citrus, and beans - on the Caicos Islands. The tourism
sector expanded in 1995, posting a 10% increase in the first quarter
as compared to the same period in 1994. The US was the leading source
of tourists in 1995, accounting for upward of 70% of arrivals or about
60,000 visitors. Major sources of government revenue include fees from
offshore financial activities and customs receipts as the Islands rely
on imports for nearly all consumption and capital goods.
