@Russia:Economy

 Overview: Russia, a vast country with a wealth of natural resources, a
 well-educated population, and a diverse industrial base, continues to
 experience formidable difficulties in moving from its old centrally
 planned economy to a modern market economy. President YEL'TSIN's
 government has made substantial strides in converting to a market
 economy since launching its economic reform program in January 1992 by
 freeing nearly all prices, slashing defense spending, eliminating the
 old centralized distribution system, completing an ambitious voucher
 privatization program, establishing private financial institutions,
 and decentralizing foreign trade. Russia, however, has made little
 progress in a number of key areas that are needed to provide a solid
 foundation for the transition to a market economy. Financial
 stabilization has remained elusive, with wide swings in monthly
 inflation rates. Only limited restructuring of industry has occurred
 so far because of a scarcity of investment funds and the failure of
 enterprise managers to make hard cost-cutting decisions. In addition,
 Moscow has yet to develop a social safety net that would allow faster
 restructuring by relieving enterprises of the burden of providing
 social benefits for their workers and has been slow to develop the
 legal framework necessary to fully support a market economy and to
 encourage foreign investment. As a result, output has continued to
 fall. According to Russian official data, which probably overstate the
 fall, GDP declined by 15% in 1994 compared with a 12% decline in 1993.
 Industrial output in 1994 fell 21% with all major sectors taking a
 hit. Agricultural production in 1994 was down 9%. The grain harvest
 totaled 81 million tons, some 15 million tons less than in 1993.
 Unemployment climbed to an estimated 6.6 million or about 7% of the
 work force by yearend 1994. Floundering Russian firms have already had
 to put another 4.8 million workers on involuntary, unpaid leave or
 shortened workweeks. Government fears of large-scale unemployment
 continued to hamper industrial restructuring efforts. According to
 official Russian data, real per capita income was up nearly 18% in
 1994 compared with 1993, in part because many Russians are working
 second jobs. Most Russians perceive that they are worse off now
 because of growing crime and health problems and mounting wage
 arrears. Russia has made significant headway in privatizing state
 assets, completing its voucher privatization program at midyear 1994.
 At least a portion of about 110,000 state enterprises were transferred
 to private hands by the end of 1994. Including partially privatized
 firms, the private sector accounted for roughly half of GDP in 1994.
 Financial stabilization continued to remain a challenge for the
 government. Moscow tightened financial policies in late 1993 and early
 1994, including postponing planned budget spending, and succeeded in
 reducing monthly inflation from 18% in January to about 5% in July and
 August. At midyear, however, the government relaxed austerity measures
 in the face of mounting pressure from industry and agriculture,
 sparking a new round of inflation; the monthly inflation rate jumped
 to roughly 15% per month during the fourth quarter. In response,
 Moscow announced a fairly tight government budget for 1995 designed to
 bring monthly inflation down to around 1% by the end of 1995.
 According to official statistics, Russia's 1994 trade with nations
 outside the former Soviet Union produced a $12.3 billion surplus, up
 from $11.3 billion in 1993. Foreign sales - comprised largely of oil,
 natural gas, and other raw materials - grew more than 8%. Imports also
 were up 8% as demand for food and other consumer goods surged. Russian
 trade with other former Soviet republics continued to decline. At the
 same time, Russia paid only a fraction of the roughly $20 billion in
 debt that came due in 1994, and by the end of the year, Russia's hard
 currency foreign debt had risen to nearly $100 billion. Moscow reached
 agreement to restructure debts with Paris Club official creditors in
 mid-1994 and concluded a preliminary deal with its commercial bank
 creditors late in the year to reschedule debts owed them in early
 1995. Capital flight continued to be a serious problem in 1994, with
 billions of additional dollars in assets being moved abroad, primarily
 to bank accounts in Europe. Russia's physical plant continues to
 deteriorate because of insufficient maintenance and new construction.
 Plant and equipment on average are twice the age of the West's. Many
 years will pass before Russia can take full advantage of its natural
 resources and its human assets.

 installed in homes 15,400,000; total pay phones for long distant calls
 34,100; about 164 telephones/1,000 persons; Russia is enlisting
 foreign help, by means of joint ventures, to speed up the
 modernization of its telecommunications system; in 1992, only 661,000
 new telephones were installed compared with 855,000 in 1991, and in
 1992 the number of unsatisfied applications for telephones reached
 11,000,000; expanded access to international E-mail service available
 via Sprint network; the inadequacy of Russian telecommunications is a
 severe handicap to the economy, especially with respect to
 international connections
 local: NMT-450 analog cellular telephone networks are operational and
 growing in Moscow and St. Petersburg
 intercity: intercity fiberoptic cable installation remains limited
 international: international traffic is handled by an inadequate
 system of satellites, land lines, microwave radio relay and outdated
 submarine cables; this traffic passes through the international
 gateway switch in Moscow which carries most of the international
 traffic for the other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent
 States; a new Russian Raduga satellite will link Moscow and St.

 note: the Intelligence Community estimates that defense spending in
 Russia fell about 15% in real terms in 1994, reducing Russian defense
 outlays to about one-fourth of peak Soviet levels in the late 1980s;
 although Russia may still spend as much as 10% of its GDP on defense,
 this is significantly below the 15% to 17% burden the former USSR
 carried during much of the 1980s; conversion of military expenditures
 into US dollars using the current exchange rate could produce
 misleading results

@Rwanda:Economy

 Overview: Rwanda is a poor African nation suffering bitterly from
 ethnic-based civil war. Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural
 sector; coffee and tea make up 80%-90% of total exports. The amount of
 fertile land is limited, however, and deforestation and soil erosion
 continue to create problems. The industrial sector in Rwanda is small,
 contributing only 17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses mainly on the
 processing of agricultural products. The Rwandan economy remains
 dependent on coffee/tea exports and foreign aid. Weak international
 prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita
 GDP to decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank
 began in October 1990. Ethnic-based insurgency since 1990 has
 devastated wide areas, especially in the north, and displaced hundreds
 of thousands of people. A peace accord in mid-1993 temporarily ended
 most of the fighting, but massive resumption of civil warfare in April
 1994 in the capital city Kigali and elsewhere has been taking
 thousands of lives and severely affecting short-term economic
 prospects. The economy suffers massively from failure to maintain the
 infrastructure, looting, neglect of important cash crops, and lack of
 health care facilities.

@Saint Lucia:Economy

 Overview: Though foreign investment in manufacturing and information
 processing in recent years has increased Saint Lucia's industrial
 base, the economy remains vulnerable due to its heavy dependence on
 banana production, which is subject to periodic droughts and tropical
 storms. Indeed, the destructive effect of Tropical Storm Debbie in
 mid-1994 caused the loss of 60% of the year's banana crop. Increased
 competition from Latin American bananas will probably further reduce
 market prices, exacerbating Saint Lucia's need to diversify its
 economy in coming years, e.g., by expanding tourism, manufacturing,
 and construction

@Saint Pierre And Miquelon:Economy

 Overview: The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood
 by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of
 Newfoundland. The economy has been declining, however, because the
 number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the
 years. In March 1989, an agreement between France and Canada set fish
 quotas for Saint Pierre's trawlers fishing in Canadian and
 Canadian-claimed waters for three years. The agreement settles a
 longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish exports to a
 halt. The islands are heavily subsidized by France. Imports come
 primarily from Canada and France.
