 Environment:
 current issues: radioactive or toxic chemical sites associated with
 its former defense industries and test ranges are found throughout the
 country and pose health risks for humans and animals; industrial
 pollution is severe in some cities; because the two main rivers which
 flowed into the Aral Sea have been diverted for irrigation, it is
 drying up and leaving behind a harmful layer of chemical pesticides
 and natural salts; these substances are then picked up by the wind and
 blown into noxious dust storms; pollution in the Caspian Sea; soil
 pollution from overuse of agricultural chemicals and salinization from
 faulty irrigation practices

@Kazakhstan:Economy

 Overview: Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former Soviet states
 in territory, possesses enormous untapped fossil-fuel reserves as well
 as plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals. It also has
 considerable agricultural potential with its vast steppe lands
 accommodating both livestock and grain production. Kazakhstan's
 industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these
 natural resources and also on a relatively large machine building
 sector specializing in construction equipment, tractors, agricultural
 machinery, and some defense items. The breakup of the USSR and the
 collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's traditional heavy industry
 products have resulted in a sharp contraction of the economy since
 1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. The
 government has pursued a moderate program of economic reform and
 privatization which is gradually lifting state controls over economic
 activity and shifting assets into the private sector. Nevertheless,
 government control over key sectors of the economy remains strong.
 Sustained economic hardships and continued pressures from industrial
 elites will make it difficult for the government to sustain its
 policies of monetary and fiscal discipline which had brought down
 inflation by the end of 1994. Continued lack of pipeline
 transportation for expanded oil exports has closed off a likely source
 of economic recovery.

@Kenya:Economy

 Overview: Kenya in recent years has had one of the highest natural
 rates of growth in population, but the statistics have been
 complicated by the large-scale movement of nomadic groups and of
 Somalis back and forth across the border. Population growth has been
 accompanied by deforestation, deterioration in the road system, the
 water supply, and other parts of the infrastructure. In industry and
 services, Nairobi's reluctance to embrace IMF-supported reforms had
 held back investment and growth in 1991-93. Nairobi's push on economic
 reform in 1994, however, helped support a 3.3% increase in output.

@Kiribati:Economy

 Overview: A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls, Kiribati has
 few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate deposits were
 exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and fish now
 represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has
 fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP declined about 5% in 1987,
 as the fish catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the level of 1986
 and copra production was hampered by repeated rains. Output rebounded
 strongly in 1988, with real GDP growing by 10%. The upturn in economic
 growth came from an increase in copra production and a good fish
 catch. GDP then fell by 2.2% in 1989 and by 2.9% in 1990, but has
 risen by about 3% annually in 1991-93. Foreign financial aid, largely
 from the UK and Japan, is a critical supplement to GDP, amounting to
 25%-50% of GDP in recent years.

@Korea, North:Economy

 Overview: More than 90% of this command economy is socialized;
 agricultural land is collectivized; and state-owned industry produces
 95% of manufactured goods. State control of economic affairs is
 unusually tight even for a Communist country because of the small size
 and homogeneity of the society and the strict rule of KIM Il-song in
 the past and now his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during the
 period 1984-88 averaged 2%-3%, but output declined by 3%-5% annually
 during 1989-92 because of systemic problems and disruptions in
 socialist-style economic relations with the former USSR and China. In
 1992, output dropped sharply, by perhaps 7%-9%, as the economy felt
 the cumulative effect of the reduction in outside support. The
 leadership insisted on maintaining its high level of military outlays
 from a shrinking economic pie. Moreover, a serious drawdown in
 inventories and critical shortages in the energy sector have led to
 increasing interruptions in industrial production. Abundant mineral
 resources and hydropower have formed the basis of industrial
 development since World War II. Output of the extractive industries
 includes coal, iron ore, magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead, and
 precious metals. Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry,
 including military industry, with light industry lagging far behind.
 Despite the use of improved seed varieties, expansion of irrigation,
 and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea has not yet become
 self-sufficient in food production. Indeed, a shortage of arable
 lands, several years of poor harvests, and a cumbersome distribution
 system have resulted in chronic food shortages. The collapse of
 Communism in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in 1989-91 has
 disrupted important technological links. North Korea remains far
 behind South Korea in economic development and living standards. GDP
 is stagnant.

@Korea, South:Economy

 Overview: The driving force behind the economy's dynamic growth has
 been the planned development of an export-oriented economy in a
 vigorously entrepreneurial society. Real GDP increased more than 10%
 annually between 1986 and 1991. This growth ultimately led to an
 overheated situation characterized by a tight labor market, strong
 inflationary pressures, and a rapidly rising current account deficit.
 As a result, in 1992, economic policy focused on slowing the growth
 rate of inflation and reducing the deficit. Annual growth slowed to
 5%, still above the rate in most other countries of the world, and
 recovered to 6.3% in 1993. The economy expanded by 8.3% in 1994,
 driven by booming exports.

@Kuwait:Economy

 Overview: Kuwait is a small and relatively open economy with proved
 crude oil reserves of about 94 billion barrels - 10% of world
 reserves. Kuwait has rebuilt its war-ravaged petroleum sector; its
 crude oil production reached at least 2.0 million barrels per day by
 the end of 1993. The government ran a sizable fiscal deficit in 1993.
 Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP and 90% of export and
 government revenues. Kuwait lacks water and has practically no arable
 land, thus preventing development of agriculture. With the exception
 of fish, it depends almost wholly on food imports. About 75% of
 potable water must be distilled or imported. Because of its high per
 capita income, comparable with Western European incomes, Kuwait
 provides its citizens with extensive health, educational, and
 retirement benefits. Per capita military expenditures are among the
 highest in the world. The economy improved moderately in 1994, with
 the growth in industry and finance, and should see further gains in
 1995, especially if oil prices go up. The World Bank has urged Kuwait
