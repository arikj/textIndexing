@Madagascar:Economy

 Overview: Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world,
 suffering from chronic malnutrition, underfunded health and education
 facilities, a 3% annual population growth rate, and severe loss of
 forest cover, accompanied by erosion. Agriculture, including fishing
 and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for over 30%
 of GDP and contributing more than 70% of total export earnings.
 Industry is largely confined to the processing of agricultural
 products and textile manufacturing; in 1991 it accounted for only 13%
 of GDP. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year development plan
 that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by 1990,
 increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports.
 Subsequently, growth in output has been held back because of
 protracted antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political
 reform. Since 1993, corruption and political instability have caused
 the economy and infrastructure to decay further. Since April 1994, the
 government commitment to economic reforms has been erratic. Enormous
 obstacles stand in the way of Madagascar's realizing its considerable
 growth potential.

@Malawi:Economy

 Overview: Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's least developed
 countries. The economy is predominately agricultural, with about 90%
 of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for 40%
 of GDP and 90% of export revenues. After two years of weak
 performance, economic growth improved significantly in 1988-91 as a
 result of good weather and a broadly based economic adjustment effort
 by the government. Drought cut overall output sharply in 1992, but the
 lost ground was recovered in 1993. The economy depends on substantial
 inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and
 individual donor nations. The new government faces strong challenges,
 e.g., to spur exports, to improve educational and health facilities,
 and to deal with environmental problems of deforestation and erosion.

 soundly managed public sector, has posted a remarkable record of 9%

@Maldives:Economy

 Overview: Fishing is the largest industry, employing 25% of the work
 force and accounting for over 60% of exports. Over 90% of government
 tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes. During
 the 1980s tourism became one of the most important and highest growth
 sectors of the economy. In 1993, tourism accounted for 17% of GDP and
 more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. The
 Maldivian government initiated an economic reform program in 1989
 initially by lifting import quotas and opening some exports to the
 private sector. Subsequently, it has liberalized regulations to allow
 more foreign investment. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to
 play a minor role in the economy, constrained by the limited
 availability of cultivatable land and the shortage of domestic labor.
 Most staple foods must be imported. In 1993, industry which consisted
 mainly of garment production, boat building, and handicrafts accounted
 for about 6% of GDP.

@Mali:Economy

 Overview: Mali is among the poorest countries in the world, with 65%
 of its land area desert or semidesert. Economic activity is largely
 confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger. About 10% of the
 population is nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is engaged in
 agriculture and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on
 processing farm commodities. The economy is beginning to turn around
 after contracting through 1992-93, largely because of enhanced exports
 and import substitute production in the wake of the 50% devaluation of
 January 1994. Post-devaluation inflation appears to have peaked at 35%
 in 1994 and the government appears to be keeping on track with its IMF
 structural adjustment program.

@Malta:Economy

 Overview: Significant resources are limestone, a favorable geographic
 location, and a productive labor force. Malta produces only about 20%
 of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has no
 domestic energy sources. Consequently, the economy is highly dependent
 on foreign trade and services. Manufacturing and tourism are the
 largest contributors to the economy. Manufacturing accounts for about
 24% of GDP, with the electronics and textile industries major
 contributors and with the state-owned Malta drydocks employing about
 4,300 people. In 1994, over 1,000,000 tourists visited the island. Per
 capita GDP of $10,760 places Malta in the range of the less affluent
 EU countries.
