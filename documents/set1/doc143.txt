@South Africa:Economy

 Overview: Many of the white one-seventh of the South African
 population enjoy incomes, material comforts, and health and
 educational standards equal to those of Western Europe. In contrast,
 most of the remaining population suffers from the poverty patterns of
 the Third World, including unemployment and lack of job skills. The
 main strength of the economy lies in its rich mineral resources, which
 provide two-thirds of exports. Economic developments for the remainder
 of the 1990s will be driven largely by the new government's attempts
 to improve black living conditions, to set the country on an
 aggressive export-led growth path, and to cut back the enormous
 numbers of unemployed. The economy in recent years has absorbed less
 than 5% of the more than 300,000 workers entering the labor force
 annually. Local economists estimate that the economy must grow between
 5% and 6% in real terms annually to absorb all of the new entrants,
 much less reduce the accumulated total.

@Spain:Economy

 Overview: Spain, with a per capita output approximately two-thirds
 that of the four leading economies of Western Europe, has shared with
 these countries the recession of the early 1990s and the upturn of
 their economic fortunes in 1994. But whereas unemployment in these
 countries has hovered just above 10%, Spain has been forced to cope
 with a 25% unemployment rate. Continued political turmoil has
 complicated the establishment of stable government policies toward
 budgetary restraint, interest rates, labor law reform, and Spain's
 role in the evolving economic integration of Western Europe. Because
 the recession has been so deep, the growth in industrial output,
 tourism, and other sectors in 1994, while welcome, falls far short of
 the growth required to bring unemployment down to, say, 10%. The
 recovery in the economies of major trade partners, the comparatively
 low inflation rate, lower interest rates, and prospects in the tourist
 sector suggest that Spain can make substantial progress in 1995.

@Sri Lanka:Economy

 Overview: Industry - dominated by the fast-growing apparel industry -
 has surpassed agriculture as the main source of export earnings and
 accounts for over 16% of GDP. The economy has been plagued by high
 rates of unemployment since the late 1970s. Economic growth, which has
 been depressed by ethnic unrest, accelerated in 1991-94 as domestic
 conditions began to improve and conditions for foreign investment
 brightened. Currently, however, the new government's emphasis on
 populist measures has clouded Sri Lanka's economic prospects.

@Sudan:Economy

 Overview: Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political
 instability, adverse weather, high inflation, a drop in remittances
 from abroad, and counterproductive economic policies. Governmental
 entities account for more than 70% of new investment. The private
 sector's main areas of activity are agriculture and trading, with most
 private industrial investment predating 1980. Agriculture employs 80%
 of the work force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items.
 Sluggish economic performance over the past decade, attributable
 largely to declining annual rainfall, has reduced levels of per capita
 income and consumption. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages
 continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary
 Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because
 of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund. After Sudan backtracked
 on promised reforms in 1992-93, the IMF threatened to expel Sudan from
 the Fund. To avoid expulsion, Khartoum agreed to make payments on its
 arrears to the Fund, liberalize exchange rates, and reduce subsidies.
 These measures have been partially implemented. The government's
 continued prosecution of the civil war and its growing international
 isolation led to a further deterioration of the nonagricultural
 sectors of the economy during 1994. Agriculture, on the other hand,
 after several disappointing years, enjoyed a bumper fall harvest in
 1994; its strong performance produced an overall growth rate in GDP of
 perhaps 7%.

 activity, and hard currency shortfalls continue to mark the economy.
