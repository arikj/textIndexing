Economy

Economy - overview: The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily
upon revenues from the oil sector, which contributes practically all
export earnings and about one-third of GDP. In 1990 per capita GDP was
the highest in Africa at $5,410, but subsequently GDP growth has
slowed on average and has fluctuated sharply in response to changes in
the world oil market. Import restrictions and inefficient resource
allocations have led to periodic shortages of basic goods and
foodstuffs. The nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors, which
account for about 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly
agricultural products to include the production of petrochemicals,
iron, steel, and aluminum. Although agriculture accounts for only 5%
of GDP, it employs 18% of the labor force. Climatic conditions and
poor soils severely limit farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of
its food requirements. The UN sanctions imposed in April 1992 have not
yet had a major impact on the economy because Libya's oil revenues
generate sufficient foreign exchange to sustain imports of food,
consumer goods, and equipment for the oil industry and ongoing
development projects.

Economy

Economy - overview: Despite its small size and limited natural
resources, Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly
industrialized, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service
sector and living standards on a par with the urban areas of its large
European neighbors. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 18% -
and easy incorporation rules have induced about 25,000 holding or
so-called letter box companies to establish nominal offices in
Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state revenues. The country
participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss
franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy
requirements. Liechtenstein is a member of the European Economic Area
(an organization serving as a bridge between EFTA and EU) since May
1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies
with those of an integrated Europe.

Economy

Economy - overview: Since declaring independence in 1990, Lithuania
has implemented reforms aimed at eliminating the vestiges of the
former socialist system. With the help of the IMF and other
international institutions, the government has adopted a disciplined
program to restrain inflation, abolish most price controls, lower the
budget deficit, and privatize the economy. More than two-thirds of its
industrial facilities as well as most housing and agricultural
enterprises have been privatized. Although some important "strategic"
enterprises remain exempt from privatization, the new government has
outlined plans to privatize large companies dealing with transport,
pipelines, communications, and energy. While Lithuania has reduced its
trade dependence on Russia and other republics of the FSU from 85% in
1991 to about 40% in 1995, Russia remains Lithuania's leading trading
partner. Lithuania has made great strides in reducing its annual rate
of inflation - from over 1,100% in 1992 to about 35% in 1995 and 13.1%
in 1996. Although the government tried to stay the course on economic
reform and fiscal discipline in 1996, the new government, which took
office in 1996 inherited high debts for energy supplies. As for real
resources, Lithuania's growth depends largely on its ability to
exploit its strategic location - with its ice-free port at Klaipeda
and its rail and highway hub in Vilnius connecting it with Eastern
Europe, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. Lacking important natural
resources, it will remain dependent on imports of fuels and raw
materials.

Economy

Economy - overview: The stable, prosperous economy features moderate
growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. Agriculture is based on
small family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until recently
dominated by steel, has become increasingly more diversified. During
the past decades, growth in the financial sector has more than
compensated for the decline in steel. Services, especially banking,
account for a growing proportion of the economy. Luxembourg
participates in an economic union with Belgium on trade and most
financial matters, is also closely connected economically to the
Netherlands, and, as a member of the EU, enjoys the advantages of the
open European market.

Economy

Economy - overview: The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
although the poorest republic in the former Yugoslav federation, can
meet basic food and energy needs through its own agricultural and coal
resources. The economy slowly rebounded in 1996 after years of

redevelop trade ties with Greece and Serbia and Montenegro; as well as
on Skopje's continued commitment to economic liberalization. The
economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas and most
of its modern machinery and parts. An important supplement of GDP is
the remittances from thousands of Macedonians working in Germany and
other West European nations.
