@Sao Tome and Principe, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the country gained
  independence nearly 15 years ago. Since then, however, cocoa
  production has gradually deteriorated because of drought and
  mismanagement, so that by 1987 output had fallen to less than 50% of
  its former levels. As a result, a shortage of cocoa for export has
  created a serious balance-of-payments problem. Production of less
  important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm kernels, has also
  declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of exports by a
  ratio of 4:1. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense of other
  food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of food needs. It
  also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods. Over the
  years, Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt, which
  amounts to roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable potential
  exists for development of a tourist industry, and the government has
  taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The government also
  implemented a Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to restructure the
  economy and reschedule external debt service payments in cooperation
  with the International Development Association and Western lenders.

@Saudi Arabia, Economy

Overview: 
  The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 75% of budget revenues, 35%
  of GDP, and almost all export earnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest
  reserves of petroleum in the world, ranks as the largest exporter of
  petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the
  government intends to bring its budget, which has been in deficit
  since 1983, back into balance, and to encourage private economic
  activity. Roughly four million foreign workers play an important role
  in the Saudi economy, for example, in the oil and banking sectors. For
  about a decade, Saudi Arabia's domestic and international outlays have
  outstripped its income, and the government has cut its foreign
  assistance and is beginning to rein in domestic programs.

@Senegal, Economy

Overview: 
  After 14 years of mixed compliance with IMF and World Bank economic
  reform programs, Senegal finds its economy remains hostage to negative
  economic forces. Declining terms of trade, weather-related setbacks,
  and relentless growth in population have held back overall growth and
  left per capita incomes stagnant, if not diminished. The economy
  continues to rely on exports of fish, peanuts, and phosphates for hard
  currency earnings. A 50% devaluation of the African franc in January
  1994 is likely to lead to substantial increases in local currency
  prices for producers that may spur improved production. A sheltered
  import-substitution sector, comprising textiles, shoes, and other
  light manufacturing, will remain plagued, however, by high labor,
  transportation, and energy costs. Public finances face a decade-long
  trend in declining tax revenues, making the government increasingly
  dependent on official development assistance from bilateral donors.

@Serbia and Montenegro, Economy

Overview: 
  The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation has been followed by
  bloody ethnic warfare, the destabilization of republic boundaries, and
  the breakup of important interrepublic trade flows. Serbia and
  Montenegro faces major economic problems; output has dropped sharply,
  particularly in 1993. First, like the other former Yugoslav republics,
  it depended on its sister republics for large amounts of foodstuffs,
  energy supplies, and manufactures. Wide varieties in climate, mineral
  resources, and levels of technology among the republics accentuate
  this interdependence, as did the communist practice of concentrating
  much industrial output in a small number of giant plants. The breakup
  of many of the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial
  plants lost suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical
  assets in the fighting all have contributed to the economic
  difficulties of the republics. One singular factor in the economic
  situation of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a
  communist government that is primarily interested in political and
  military mastery, not economic reform. A further complication is the
  imposition of economic sanctions by the UN.

  well-distributed rainfall and a long growing season; produces fruit,
  grapes, and cereals; in this area, livestock production (sheep and
  cattle) and dairy farming prosper; Kosovo produces fruits, vegetables,
  tobacco, and a small amount of cereals; the mountainous pastures of
  Kosovo and Montenegro support sheep and goat husbandry; Montenegro has
  only a small agriculture sector, mostly near the coast where a
  Mediterranean climate permits the culture of olives, citrus, grapes,
  and rice

Overview: 
  In this small, open, tropical island economy, the tourist industry
  employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of
  hard currency earnings. In recent years the government has encouraged
  foreign investment in order to upgrade hotels and other services. At
  the same time, the government has moved to reduce the high dependence
  on tourism by promoting the development of farming, fishing, and
  small-scale manufacturing.
