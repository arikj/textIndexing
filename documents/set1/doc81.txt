@Hungary, Economy

Overview: 
  Hungary is still in the midst of a difficult transition from a command
  to a market economy. Its economic reforms during the Communist era
  gave it a head start on this process, particularly in terms of
  attracting foreign investors - Hungary has accounted for about half of
  all foreign direct investment in Eastern Europe since 1989.
  Nonetheless, the economy continued to contract in 1993, with real GDP
  falling perhaps 1%. Although the privatization process has lagged, in
  December 1993 Hungary carried out the largest privatization yet in
  Eastern Europe, selling a controlling interest in the Matav
  telecommunications firm to private investors - including a 30% share
  to a US-German consortium for $875 million. Overall, about half of GDP
  now originates in the private sector. Unemployment rose to about 13%
  in 1993 while inflation remained above 20%, and falling exports pushed
  the trade deficit to about $3 billion. The government hopes that
  economic recovery in Western Europe in 1994 will boost exports, lower
  the trade deficit, and help jump-start the economy. The budget,
  however, is likely to remain a serious concern; depressed tax revenue
  pushed up the budget deficit in 1993.

@Iceland, Economy

Overview: 
  Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically capitalistic, but
  with an extensive welfare system, relatively low unemployment, and
  comparatively even distribution of income. The economy is heavily
  dependent on the fishing industry, which provides nearly 75% of export
  earnings and employs 12% of the workforce. In the absence of other
  natural resources - except energy - Iceland's economy is vulnerable to
  changing world fish prices. Iceland's economy has been in recession
  since 1988. The recession continued in 1993 due to a third year of
  cutbacks in fishing quotas as well as falling world prices for the
  country's main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and
  ferrosilicon. Real GDP declined 3.3% in 1992 and rose slightly, by
  0.4%, in 1993. The center-right government's economic goals include
  reducing the budget and current account deficits, limiting foreign
  borrowing, containing inflation, revising agricultural and fishing
  policies, diversifying the economy, and privatizing state-owned
  industries. The recession has led to a wave of bankruptcies and
  mergers throughout the economy, as well as the highest unemployment of
  the post-World War II period. Inflation, previously a serious problem,
  declined from double digit rates in the 1980s to only 3.7% in 1992-93.

@India, Economy

Overview: 
  India's economy is a mixture of traditional village farming, modern
  agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a
  multitude of support services. Faster economic growth in the 1980s
  permitted a significant increase in real per capita private
  consumption. A large share of the population, perhaps as much as 40%,
  remains too poor to afford an adequate diet. Financial strains in 1990
  and 1991 prompted government austerity measures that slowed industrial
  growth but permitted India to meet its international payment
  obligations without rescheduling its debt. Policy reforms since 1991
  have extended earlier economic liberalization and greatly reduced
  government controls on production, trade, and investment. US and other
  foreign firms are increasing their investment in India. In January
  1994, international financial reserves were comfortably high.

@Indian Ocean, Economy

Overview: 
  The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting the Middle East,
  Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas. It carries a
  particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products from
  the oil fields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its fish are of
  great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic
  consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, Korea, and
  Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.
  Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the offshore areas
  of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western Australia. An estimated 40%
  of the world's offshore oil production comes from the Indian Ocean.
  Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are
  actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly India, South
  Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
Industries: 
  based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly fish,
  minerals, oil and gas, fishing, sand and gravel

@Indonesia, Economy

Overview: 
  Indonesia is a mixed economy with some socialist institutions and
  central planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and
  private enterprise. Indonesia has extensive natural wealth, yet, with
  a large and rapidly increasing population, it remains a poor country.
  Real GDP growth in 1985-93 averaged about 6%, quite impressive, but
  not sufficient to both slash underemployment and absorb the 2.3
  million workers annually entering the labor force. Agriculture,
  including forestry and fishing, is an important sector, accounting for
  21% of GDP and over 50% of the labor force. The staple crop is rice.
  Once the world's largest rice importer, Indonesia is now nearly
  self-sufficient. Plantation crops - rubber and palm oil - and textiles
  and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job generation.
  Industrial output now accounts for almost 40% of GDP and is based on a
  supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas,
  timber, metals, and coal. Foreign investment has also boosted
  manufacturing output and exports in recent years. Indeed, the
  economy's growth is highly dependent on the continuing expansion of
  nonoil exports. Japan remains Indonesia's most important customer and
  supplier of aid. Rapid growth in the money supply in 1989-90 prompted
  Jakarta to implement a tight monetary policy in 1991, forcing the
  private sector to go to foreign banks for investment financing. Real
  interest rates remained above 10% and off-shore commercial debt grew.
  The growth in off-shore debt prompted Jakarta to limit foreign
  borrowing beginning in late 1991. Despite the continued problems in
  moving toward a more open financial system and the persistence of a
  fairly tight credit situation, GDP growth in 1992 and 1993 has matched
  the government target of 6%-7% annual growth.

@Iran, Economy

Overview: 
  Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of
  oil and other large enterprises, village agriculture, and small-scale
  private trading and service ventures. Over the past several years, the
  government has introduced several measures to liberalize the economy
  and reduce government intervention, but most of these changes have
  moved slowly because of political opposition. Iran has faced
  increasingly severe financial difficulties in 1992-93 due to an import
  surge since 1989 and general financial mismanagement. At yearend 1993
  the Iranian Government estimated that it owed foreign creditors about
  $30 billion; an estimated $8 billion of this debt was in arrears.
  Earnings from oil exports--which provide over 90% of Iran's export
  revenues--are providing less relief to Iran than usual because of
  declining oil prices. Estimated overall growth was a robust 6.3% in
  1992 and a moderate 3% in 1993.
