@Libya:Economy

 Overview: The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon
 revenues from the oil sector, which contributes practically all export
 earnings and about one-third of GDP. In 1990 per capita GDP was the
 highest in Africa at $5,410, but GDP growth rates have slowed and
 fluctuated sharply in response to changes in the world oil market.
 Import restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to
 periodic shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs. Windfall revenues
 from the hike in world oil prices in late 1990 improved the foreign
 payments position and resulted in a current account surplus through
 1992. The nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors, which account
 for about 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly
 agricultural products to include petrochemicals, iron, steel, and
 aluminum. Although agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it employs
 18% of the labor force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely
 limit farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food
 requirements. The UN sanctions imposed in April 1992 have not yet had
 a major impact on the economy because Libya's oil revenues generate
 sufficient foreign exchange which sustains imports of food, consumer
 goods, and equipment for the oil industry and ongoing development
 projects.

 Overview: Despite its small size and limited natural resources,
 Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly industrialized,
 free-enterprise economy with a vital service sector and living
 standards on par with its large European neighbors. Low business taxes
 - the maximum tax rate is 20% - and easy incorporation rules have
 induced about 25,000 holding or so-called letter box companies to
 establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state
 revenues. The country participates in a customs union with Switzerland
 and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. Liechtenstein plans
 to join the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a
 bridge between EFTA and EU) in 1995.

@Lithuania:Economy

 Overview: Since independence in September 1991, Lithuania has made
 steady progress in developing a market economy. Almost 50% of state
 property has been privatized and trade is diversifying with a gradual
 shift away from the former Soviet Union to Western markets. In
 addition, the Lithuanian government has adhered to a disciplined
 budgetary and financial policy which has brought inflation down from a
 monthly average of around 14% in first half 1993 to an average of 3.1%
 in 1994. Nevertheless, the process has been painful with industrial
 output in 1993 less than half the 1991 level. The economy appeared to
 have bottomed out in 1994, and Vilnius's policies have laid the
 groundwork for vigorous recovery over the next few years. Recovery
 will build on Lithuanian's strategic location with its ice-free port
 at Klaipeda and its rail and highway hub in Vilnius connecting it with
 Eastern Europe, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, and on its agriculture
 potential, highly skilled labor force, and diversified industrial
 sector. Lacking important natural resources, it will remain dependent
 on imports of fuels and raw materials.

@Luxembourg:Economy

 Overview: The stable, prosperous economy features moderate growth, low
 inflation, and negligible unemployment. Agriculture is based on small
 but highly productive family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until
 recently dominated by steel, has become increasingly more diversified,
 particularly toward high-technology firms. During the past decade,
 growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the
 decline in steel. Services, especially banking, account for a growing
 proportion of the economy. Luxembourg participates in an economic
 union with Belgium on trade and most financial matters, is also
 closely connected economically to the Netherlands, and as a member of
 the 15-member European Union enjoys the advantages of the open
 European market.

@Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic Of:Economy

 Overview: The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, although the
 poorest republic in the former Yugoslav federation, can meet basic
 food and energy needs through its own agricultural and coal resources.
 Its economic decline will continue unless ties are reforged or
 enlarged with its neighbors Serbia and Montenegro, Albania, Greece,
 and Bulgaria. The economy depends on outside sources for all of its
 oil and gas and most of its modern machinery and parts. An important
 supplement of GDP is the remittances from thousands of Macedonians
 working in Germany and other West European nations. Continued
 political turmoil, both internally and in the region as a whole,
 prevents any swift readjustments of trade patterns and economic
 programs. The country's industrial output and GDP are expected to
 decline further in 1995. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's
 geographical isolation, technological backwardness, and potential
 political instability place it far down the list of countries of
 interest to Western investors. Resolution of the dispute with Greece
 and an internal commitment to economic reform would encourage foreign
 investment over the long run. In the immediate future, the worst
 scenario for the economy would be the spread of fighting across its
 borders.
