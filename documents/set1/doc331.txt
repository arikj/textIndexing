WORDS OF A SONG

Mdng-en-ny-wau-yen-go-nah, bar-ri-boo-lah, bar-re-mah. This they begin at
the top of their voices, and continue as long as they can in one breath,
sinking to the lowest note, and then rising again to the highest. The
words are the names of deceased persons.

E-i-ah wan-ge-wah, chian-go, wan-de-go. The words of another song, sung
in the same manner as the preceding, and of the same meaning.

I met with only two or three words which bore a resemblance to any other
language.

The middle head of Port Jackson is named Ca-ba Ca-ba--in Portuguese Caba
signifies a head. Cam-ma-rade, a term of affection used among girls, has
a strong resemblance to the French word Cammerade; and may not some
similitude be traced between the word E-lee-mong, a shield, and the word
Telamon, the name given to the greater Ajax, on account of his being lord
of the seven-fold shield? How these words came into their language must
be a mystery till we have a more intimate knowledge of it than I can
pretend to.

I could have enlarged very much the foregoing account of the natives of
New South Wales; but, both in describing their customs and in detailing
their language, I have chosen to mention only those facts about which,
after much attention and inquiry, I could satisfy my own mind. That they
are ignorant savages cannot be disputed; but I hope they do not in the
foregoing pages appear to be wholly incapable of becoming one day
civilized and useful members of society.

POSTSCRIPT

Since the preceding account was printed, letters have been received from
New South Wales of as late date as the 20th of August 1797. By these it
appears, that his Majesty's ship _Reliance_, in her passage from the Cape
of Good Hope to Port Jackson, met with uncommon bad weather, which kept
her out eleven weeks and one day. About the latitude of 41 degrees S and
77 degrees E longitude, the sea suddenly became violently agitated, and
at last broke on board the ship, staving a boat which was over the stern,
and doing considerable damage to the ship. Captain Waterhouse, however,
landed safely thirty-nine head of black cattle, three mares, and near
sixty sheep.

Information was also received through the same channel, that a ship
called the _Sydney Cove_ had been fitted out for Port Jackson from
Bengal; but springing a leak at sea, she was run ashore on the
southernmost part of the coast of New Holland: seventeen of the crew
attempted to get to Port Jackson in their long-boat, but were driven on
shore, and lost their boat. They then attempted to reach it by land, in
which hazardous undertaking only three of them succeeded, the other either
dying on the route or being killed by the natives. They were eighty days
in performing this journey, and reported that in their way they had found
great quantities of coal. This was afterwards confirmed by the surgeon of
the _Reliance_, who went down to the wreck, and brought specimens of it
back with him, having found immense strata of this useful article. Some
part of the cargo was got on shore and housed where the ship was stranded.

When these letters left the colony, it continued in as flourishing a
state as when the _Britannia_ sailed. May it continue to prosper!
