Metric Interrelationships 

Conversions from a multiple or submultiple to the basic units of meters, 
liters, or grams can be done using the table.  For example, to convert from 
kilometers to meters, multiply by 1,000 (9.26 kilometers equals 9,260 
meters) or to convert from meters to kilometers, multiply by 0.001 (9,260 
meters equals 9.26 kilometers).
