@Ecuador, Economy

Overview: 
  Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural areas.
  Growth has been uneven because of natural disasters, fluctuations in
  global oil prices, and government policies designed to curb inflation.
  Banana exports, second only to oil, have suffered as a result of
  import quotas of the European Union and banana blight. The new
  President Sixto DURAN-BALLEN, has a much more favorable attitude
  toward foreign investment than did his predecessor. Ecuador has
  implemented trade agreements with Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and
  Venezuela and has applied for GATT membership. At the end of 1991,
  Ecuador received a standby IMF loan of $105 million, which will permit
  the country to proceed with the rescheduling of Paris Club debt. In
  September 1992, the government launched a new, macroeconomic program
  that gives more play to market forces. In 1993, the DURAN-BALLEN
  administration adopted a rigorous austerity program that resulted in
  economic stabilization, with inflation cut in half and international
  reserves boosted to a record $1.3 billion. Growth in 1993 was perhaps
  only 2% due to falling export prices, notably oil, and slow progress
  on privatization.

@Egypt, Economy

Overview: 
  Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all the Third World
  economies, most industrial plants being owned by the government.
  Overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign
  investment. Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s
  and early 1980s, but in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an
  increasingly heavy burden of debt servicing led Egypt to begin
  negotiations with the IMF for balance-of-payments support. Egypt's
  first IMF standby arrangement concluded in mid-1987 was suspended in
  early 1988 because of the government's failure to adopt promised
  reforms. Egypt signed a follow-on program with the IMF and also
  negotiated a structural adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991.
  In 1991-93 the government made solid progress on administrative
  reforms such as liberalizing exchange and interest rates but resisted
  implementing major structural reforms like streamlining the public
  sector. As a result, the economy has not gained momentum and
  unemployment has become a growing problem. Egypt probably will
  continue making uneven progress in implementing the successor programs
  with the IMF and World Bank it signed onto in late 1993. In 1992-93
  tourism plunged 20% or so because of sporadic attacks by Islamic
  extremists on tourist groups. President MUBARAK has cited population
  growth as the main cause of the country's economic troubles. The
  addition of about 1.4 million people a year to the already huge
  population of 60 million exerts enormous pressure on the 5% of the
  land area available for agriculture.

@Equatorial Guinea, Economy

Overview: 
  Agriculture, forestry, and fishing account for about half of GDP and
  nearly all exports. Subsistence farming predominates. Although
  pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for
  hard currency earnings, the deterioration of the rural economy under
  successive brutal regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led
  growth. A number of AID programs sponsored by the World Bank and the
  international donor community have failed to revitalize export
  agriculture. There is little industry; businesses for the most part
  are owned by government officials and their family members. Commerce
  accounts for about 8% of GDP and the construction, public works, and
  service sectors for about 38%. Undeveloped natural resources include
  titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil
  exploration, taking place under concessions offered to US, French, and
  Spanish firms, has been moderately successful. Increased production
  from recently discovered natural gas fields will provide a greater
  share of exports by 1995.

@Eritrea, Economy

Overview: 
  With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993, Eritrea faces the
  bitter economic problems of a small, desperately poor African country.
  Most of the population will continue to depend on subsistence farming.
  Domestic output is substantially augmented by worker remittances from
  abroad. Government revenues come from custom duties and income and
  sales taxes. Eritrea has inherited the entire coastline of Ethiopia
  and has long-term prospects for revenues from the development of
  offshore oil, offshore fishing and tourism. For the time being,
  Ethiopia will be largely dependent on Eritrean ports for its foreign
  trade.

@Estonia, Economy

Overview: 
  Bolstered by a widespread national desire to reintegrate into Western
  Europe, the Estonian government has pursued a program of market
  reforms and rough stabilization measures, which is rapidly
  transforming the economy. Two years after independence - and one year
  after the introduction of the kroon - Estonians are beginning to reap
  tangible benefits; inflation is low; production declines appear to
  have bottomed out; and living standards are rising. Economic
  restructuring is clearly underway with the once-dominant
  energy-intensive heavy industrial sectors giving way to
  labor-intensive light industry and the underdeveloped service sector.
  The private sector is growing rapidly; the share of the state
  enterprises in retail trade has steadily declined and by June 1993
  accounted for only 12.5% of total turnover, and 70,000 new jobs have
  reportedly been created as a result of new business start-ups.
  Estonia's foreign trade has shifted rapidly from East to West with the
  Western industrialized countries now accounting for two-thirds of
  foreign trade.
National product: 
  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $8.8 billion (1993 estimate from
  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and
  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993; and as
  extrapolated to 1993 using official Estonian statistics, which are
  very uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)
National product real growth rate: 
  -5% (1993 est.)
National product per capita: 
  $5,480 (1993 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices): 
  2.6% per month (1993 average)
Unemployment rate: 
  3.5% (May 1993); but large number of underemployed workers
Budget: 
revenues: 
  $223 million 
expenditures: 
  $142 million, including capital expenditures of $NA (1992)
Exports: 
  $765 million (f.o.b., 1993)
commodities: 
  textile 14%, food products 11%, vehicles 11%, metals 11% (1993)
partners:

Imports:

Industries: 
  accounts for 42% of labor force; oil shale, shipbuilding, phosphates,
  electric motors, excavators, cement, furniture, clothing, textiles,
  paper, shoes, apparel
Agriculture: 
  employs 20% of work force; very efficient by Soviet standards; net
  exports of meat, fish, dairy products, and potatoes; imports of
  feedgrains for livestock; fruits and vegetables
Illicit drugs: 
  transshipment point for illicit drugs from Central and Southwest Asia
  and Latin America to Western Europe; limited illicit opium producer;
  mostly for domestic consumption
Economic aid:

  US commitments, including Ex-Im (1992), $10 million 
Currency: 
  1 Estonian kroon (EEK) = 100 cents (introduced in August 1992)

Telecommunications:

  domestic telephone circuits, i.e. 25 telephones for each 100 persons;
  improvements are being made piecemeal, with emphasis on business needs
  and international connections; there are still about 150,000
  unfulfilled requests for telephone service; broadcast stations - 3 TV
  (provide Estonian programs as well Moscow Ostenkino's first and second
  programs); international traffic is carried to the other former USSR
  republics by land line or microwave and to other countries partly by
  leased connection to the Moscow international gateway switch, and
  partly by a new Tallinn-Helsinki fiber optic submarine cable which
  gives Estonia access to international circuits everywhere; substantial
  investment has been made in cellular systems which are operational
  throughout Estonia and also Latvia and which have access to the
  international packet switched digital network via Helsinki
