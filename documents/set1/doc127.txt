 Overview: The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting the
 Middle East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas. It
 carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum
 products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its
 fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries
 for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia,
 Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for
 shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in
 the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and western
 Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production
 comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and
 offshore placer deposits are actively exploited by bordering
 countries, particularly India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and
 Thailand.

 Industries: based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly
 fish, minerals, oil and gas, fishing, sand and gravel

@Indonesia:Economy

 Overview: Indonesia is a mixed economy with some socialist
 institutions and central planning but with a recent emphasis on
 deregulation and private enterprise. Indonesia has extensive natural
 wealth, yet, with a large and rapidly increasing population, it
 remains a rather poor country. Real GDP growth in 1985-94 averaged
 about 6%, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both slash
 underemployment and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering
 the labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an
 important sector, accounting for 21% of GDP and over 50% of the labor
 force. The staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice
 importer, Indonesia is now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation crops -
 rubber and palm oil - and textiles and plywood are being encouraged
 for both export and job generation. Industrial output now accounts for
 almost 40% of GDP and is based on a supply of diverse natural
 resources, including crude oil, natural gas, timber, metals, and coal.
 Foreign investment has also boosted manufacturing output and exports
 in recent years. Indeed, the economy's growth is highly dependent on
 the continuing expansion of nonoil exports. Japan remains Indonesia's
 most important customer and supplier of aid. Rapid growth in the money
 supply in 1989-90 prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary
 policy in 1991, forcing the private sector to go to foreign banks for
 investment financing. Real interest rates remained above 10% and
 off-shore commercial debt grew. The growth in off-shore debt prompted
 Jakarta to limit foreign borrowing beginning in late 1991. Despite the
 continued problems in moving toward a more open financial system and
 the persistence of a fairly tight credit situation, GDP growth in
 1992-94 has matched the government target of 6%-7% annual growth.

@Iran:Economy

 Overview: Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state
 ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village agriculture, and
 small-scale private trading and service ventures. Over the past
 several years, the government has introduced several measures to
 liberalize the economy and reduce government intervention, but most of
 these changes have moved slowly because of political opposition. Iran
 has faced increasingly severe financial difficulties since mid-1992
 due to an import surge that began in 1989 and general financial
 mismanagement. At yearend 1993 the Iranian Government estimated that
 it owed foreign creditors about $30 billion; an estimated $8 billion

 International disputes: Iran and Iraq restored diplomatic relations in
 1990 but are still trying to work out written agreements settling
 outstanding disputes from their eight-year war concerning border
 demarcation, prisoners-of-war, and freedom of navigation and
 sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab waterway; in November 1994, Iraq
 formally accepted the UN-demarcated border with Kuwait which had been
 spelled out in Security Council Resolutions 687 (1991), 773 (1993),
 and 883 (1993); this formally ends earlier claims to Kuwait and to
 Bubiyan and Warbah islands; potential dispute over water development
 plans by Turkey for the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers

 the feeder streams and rivers; a once sizable population of Shi'a
 Muslims, who have inhabited these areas for thousands of years, has
 been displaced; furthermore, the destruction of the natural habitat
 poses serious threats to the area's wildlife populations; inadequate
 supplies of potable water; development of Tigris-Euphrates Rivers
 system contingent upon agreements with upstream riparian Turkey; air

@Iraq:Economy

 Overview: The Ba'thist regime engages in extensive central planning
 and management of industrial production and foreign trade while
 leaving some small-scale industry and services and most agriculture to
 private enterprise. The economy has been dominated by the oil sector,
 which has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange
 earnings. In the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive
 expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export
 facilities by Iran, led the government to implement austerity measures
 and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments.
 After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased
 with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged
 facilities. Agricultural development remained hampered by labor
 shortages, salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land
 reform and collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although
 accorded high priority by the government, also was under financial
 constraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent
 international economic embargoes, and military action by an
 international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically changed
 the economic picture. Industrial and transportation facilities, which
 suffered severe damage, have been partially restored. Oil exports
 remain at less than 5% of the previous level. Shortages of spare parts
 continue. Living standards deteriorated even further in 1993 and 1994;
 consumer prices have more than doubled in both 1993 and 1994. The
 UN-sponsored economic embargo has reduced exports and imports and has
 contributed to the sharp rise in prices. The Iraqi government has been
 unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so that the economic embargo can
 be removed. The government's policies of supporting large military and
 internal security forces and of allocating resources to key supporters
 of the regime have exacerbated shortages. In brief, per capita output
 in 1993-94 is far below the 1989-90 level, but no precise estimate is
 available.

@Ireland:Economy

 Overview: The economy is small and trade dependent. Agriculture, once
 the most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts
 for 37% of GDP, about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor
 force. Although exports remain the primary engine for Ireland's robust
 growth, the economy is also benefiting from a rise in consumer
 spending and recovery in both construction and business investment.
 Ireland has substantially reduced its external debt since 1987, to 40%
 of GDP in 1994. Over the same period, inflation has fallen sharply and
 chronic trade deficits have been transformed into annual surpluses.
 Unemployment remains a serious problem, however, and job creation is
 the main focus of government policy. To ease unemployment, Dublin
 aggressively courts foreign investors and recently created a new
 industrial development agency to aid small indigenous firms.
 Government assistance is constrained by Dublin's continuing deficit
 reduction measures.

@Israel:Economy

 Overview: Israel has a market economy with substantial government
 participation. It depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw
 materials, and military equipment. Despite limited natural resources,
 Israel has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial
 sectors over the past 20 years. Industry employs about 22% of Israeli
 workers, construction 6.5%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 3.5%,
 and services most of the rest. Israel is largely self-sufficient in
 food production except for grains. Diamonds, high-technology
 equipment, and agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are
 leading exports. Israel usually posts current account deficits, which
 are covered by large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign
 loans. Roughly half of the government's external debt is owed to the
 United States, which is its major source of economic and military aid.
 To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel has been targeting
 high-technology niches in international markets, such as medical
 scanning equipment. The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former
 USSR, which topped 450,000 during the period 1990-94, increased
 unemployment, intensified housing problems, and strained the
 government budget. At the same time, the immigrants bring to the
 economy valuable scientific and professional expertise.
