Economy

Economy - overview: Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich
agricultural areas. As an exporter of primary products such as oil,
bananas, and shrimp, fluctuations in world market prices can have a
substantial domestic impact. Growth has been uneven in recent years as
the government has repeatedly initiated ill-conceived fiscal
stabilization measures. The populist government of Abdala BUCARAM
Ortiz proposed a major currency reform in 1996, but popular discontent
with new austerity measures and rampant official corruption undermined
his government's position. Congress replaced BUCARAM with Fabian
ALARCON in February 1997. ALARCON has adopted a minimalist economic
program that puts off major decisions until the next elected
government takes office in August 1998. Ecuador has joined the Word
Trade Organization in 1996, but has failed to comply with many of its
accession commitments. Growth slowed to 2.0% in 1996, due to a lack of
investment caused by political uncertainty and high domestic interest
rates.

Economy

Economy - overview: By the end of the 1980s Egypt - hit by the
collapse of the world oil market and servicing a foreign debt totaling
about $50 billion - faced crises in virtually all economic sectors.
Problems of low productivity and poor economic management were
compounded by the adverse social effects of large population growth
rates, high inflation, and massive urban overcrowding. In the face of
these pressures, in 1991, Egypt undertook wide-ranging macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reform measures. This reform effort has
been supported by three successive IMF arrangements, the last of which
was concluded in October 1996. Egypt's reform efforts - and its
participation in the Gulf war coalition - also led to massive debt
relief under the Paris Club arrangements. Egypt's foreign debt fell to
about $31 billion at yearend 1996. Although the pace of reform has
been uneven and slower than envisaged under the IMF programs,
substantial progress has been made in improving macroeconomic
performance - budget deficits have been slashed while foreign reserves
in 1996 were at an all-time high - and in moving toward a more
decentralized, market-oriented economy. Egypt was able to capitalize
on its progress during the third Middle East/North Africa economic
conference which it hosted in November 1996. Egypt's President MUBARAK
told reporters that Egypt had concluded deals worth $10 billion in
investment during the conference, 20 times the country's estimated
total direct foreign investment for the 1995/96 fiscal year. According
to press reports, Egypt and foreign investors agreed on nine
megaprojects, including the export of liquefied natural gas from Egypt
to Turkey, estimated at $2 billion to $4 billion. Egypt has a
broad-based inventory of geographic, human, and physical assets which
in a liberalized market environment could spur rapid, sustainable
growth into the next century. But rapid population growth continues to
cast a shadow over economic prospects.

Economy

Economy - overview: El Salvador possesses a fast-growing
entrepreneurial economy in which 90% of economic activity is in
private hands, with growth averaging 5% since 1990. Yet, because the
1980s were a decade of civil war and stagnation, per capita GDP has
not regained the level of the late 1970s. The rebound in the 1990s
stems from the government program, in conjunction with the IMF, of
privatization, deregulation, and fiscal stabilization. The economy now
is oriented more toward manufacturing and services compared with
agriculture. The sizable trade deficits are in the main covered by
remittances from the large number of Salvadorans abroad.

Economy

Economy - overview: Farming, forestry, and fishing account for about
half of GDP. Subsistence farming predominates. Although
pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for
hard currency earnings, the deterioration of the rural economy under
successive brutal regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led
growth. A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the
IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of the government's gross
corruption and mismanagement. Businesses, for the most part, are owned
by government officials and their family members. Undeveloped natural
resources include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial
gold. Oil exploration, taking place under concessions offered to US,
French, and Spanish firms, has been moderately successful and has
contributed to Equatorial Guinea's strong growth rates in the early
1990s. The country responded favorably to the devaluation of the CFA
franc in January 1994.

Introduction

Historical perspective: on 29 May 1991, ISAIAS Afworke, secretary
general of the Peoples' Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), which
then served as the country's legislative body, announced the formation
of the Provisional Government in Eritrea (PGE) in preparation for the
23-25 April 1993 referendum on independence for the Autonomous Region
of Eritrea; the referendum resulted in a landslide vote for
independence which was proclaimed on 27 April 1993

Economy

Economy - overview: With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993,
Eritrea faced the bitter economic problems of a small, desperately
poor African country. Most of the population must continue to depend
on subsistence farming. Domestic output (GDP) is substantially
augmented by worker remittances from abroad. Government revenues come
from custom duties and income and sales taxes. Road construction is a
top domestic priority. Shortages persist in housing, education, and
health care. Eritrea has inherited the entire coastline of Ethiopia
and has long-term prospects for revenues from the development of
offshore oil, offshore fishing, and tourism. Ethiopia is largely
dependent on Eritrean ports for its foreign commerce.
