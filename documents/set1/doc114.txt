@Benin:Economy

 Overview: The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on
 subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Growth
 in real output has averaged a sound 4% in 1991-94 but this rate barely
 exceeds the rapid population growth of 3.3%. Inflation jumped to 35%
 in 1994 (compared to 3% in 1993) following the 50% currency
 devaluation in January. Commercial and transport activities, which
 make up almost 36% of GDP, are extremely vulnerable to developments in
 Nigeria as evidenced by decreased reexport trade in 1994 due to a
 severe contraction in Nigerian demand. The industrial sector accounts
 for less than 10% of GDP and mainly produces foods, beverages, cement,
 and textiles. Support by the Paris Club and official bilateral
 creditors has eased the external debt situation in recent years. The
 government, still burdened with money-losing state enterprises and a
 bloated civil service, is gradually implementing a World Bank
 supported structural adjustment program.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $6.7 billion (1994
 est.)

@Bhutan:Economy

 Overview: The economy, one of the world's least developed, is based on
 agriculture and forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90% of
 the population and account for about half of GDP. Agriculture consists
 largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged mountains
 dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other
 infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned
 with India's through strong trade and monetary links. The industrial
 sector is small and technologically backward, with most production of
 the cottage industry type. Most development projects, such as road
 construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower
 potential and its attraction for tourists are key resources; however,
 the government limits the number of tourists to 4,000 per year to
 minimize foreign influence. Much of the impetus for growth has come
 from large public-sector companies. Nevertheless, in recent years,
 Bhutan has shifted toward decentralized development planning and
 greater private initiative. The government privatized several large
 public-sector firms, is revamping its trade regime and liberalizing
 administerial procedures over industrial licensing. The government's
 industrial contribution to GDP decreased from 13% in 1988 to about 11%
 in 1993.

@Bolivia:Economy

 Overview: With its long history of semifeudal social controls,
 dependence on volatile prices for its mineral exports, and bouts of
 hyperinflation, Bolivia has remained one of the poorest and least
 developed Latin American countries. However, Bolivia has experienced
 generally improving economic conditions since the PAZ Estenssoro
 administration (1985-89) introduced market-oriented policies which
 reduced inflation from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in 1988. PAZ
 Estenssoro was followed as President by Jaime PAZ Zamora (1989-93) who
 continued the free-market policies of his predecessor, despite
 opposition from his own party and from Bolivia's once powerful labor
 movement. By maintaining fiscal discipline, PAZ Zamora helped reduce
 inflation to 9.3% in 1993, while GDP grew by an annual average of
 3.25% during his tenure. Inaugurated in August 1993, President SANCHEZ
 DE LOZADA has vowed to advance the market-oriented economic reforms he
 helped launch as PAZ Estenssoro's planning minister. His successes so
 far have included an inflation rate that continues to decrease - the
 1994 rate of 8.5% was the lowest in ten years - the signing of a free
 trade agreement with Mexico, and progress on his unique privatization
 plan. The main privatization bill was passed by the Bolivian
 legislature in late March 1994. Related laws - one that establishes
 SIRESE, the regulatory agency that will oversee the privatizations,
 and another that outlines the rules for privatization in the
 electricity sector - were approved later in the year.

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

 Note--Bosnia and Herzegovina is set to enter its third year of
 interethnic civil strife which began in the spring of 1992 after the
 Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina held a referendum on
 independence. Bosnia's Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia -
 responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the republic
 along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to 'greater Serbia'. In
 March 1994, Bosnia's Muslims and Croats reduced the number of warring
 factions from three to two by signing an agreement in Washington, DC,
 creating the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A group of rebel
 Muslims, however, continues to battle government forces in the
 northwest enclave of Bihac. A Contact Group of countries, the US, UK,
 France, Germany, and Russia, continues to seek a resolution between
 the Federation and the Bosnian Serbs. In July of 1994 the Contact
 Group presented a plan to the warring parties that roughly equally
 divides the country between the two, while maintaining Bosnia in its
 current internationally recognized borders. The Federation agreed to
 the plan almost immediately, while the Bosnian Serbs rejected it.

@Bosnia And Herzegovina:Economy

 Overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former Yugoslav
 Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old Yugoslav
 federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in private hands,
 farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic traditionally
 has been a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly
 overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central
 planning and management. TITO had pushed the development of military
 industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large
 share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of February 1995, Bosnia and
 Herzegovina was being torn apart by the continued bitter interethnic
 warfare that has caused production to plummet, unemployment and
 inflation to soar, and human misery to multiply. No economic
 statistics for 1992-94 are available, although output clearly has
 fallen substantially below the levels of earlier years and almost
 certainly is well below $1,000 per head. The country receives
 substantial amounts of humanitarian aid from the international
 community.

 Agriculture: accounted for 9.0% of GDP in 1989; regularly produces
 less than 50% of food needs; the foothills of northern Bosnia support
 orchards, vineyards, livestock, and some wheat and corn; long winters
