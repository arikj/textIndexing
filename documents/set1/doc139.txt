@Poland:Economy

 Overview: Poland continues to make good progress in the difficult
 transition to a market economy that began on 1 January 1990, when the
 new democratic government instituted "shock therapy" by decontrolling
 prices, slashing subsidies, and drastically reducing import barriers.
 Real GDP fell sharply in 1990 and 1991, but in 1992 Poland became the
 first country in the region to resume economic growth with a 2.6%
 increase. Growth increased to 3.8% in 1993 and 5.5% in 1994 - the
 highest rate in Europe except for Albania. All of the growth since
 1991 has come from the booming private sector, which now accounts for
 at least 55% of GDP, even though privatization of the state-owned
 enterprises is proceeding slowly and most industry remains in state
 hands. Industrial production increased 12% in 1994 - led by 50% jumps
 in the output of motor vehicles, radios and televisions, and pulp and
 paper - and is now well above the 1990 level. Inflation, which had
 approached 1,200% annually in early 1990, was down to about 30% in
 1994, as the government held the budget deficit to 1.5% of GDP. After
 five years of steady increases, unemployment has leveled off at about
 16% nationwide, although it approaches 30% in some regions. The trade
 deficit was sharply reduced in 1994, due mainly to increased exports
 to Western Europe, Poland's main customer. The leftist government
 elected in September 1993 gets generally good marks from foreign
 observers for its management of the budget but is often criticized for
 not moving faster on privatization.

@Portugal:Economy

 Overview: Portugal's economy contracted 0.4% in 1993 but registered a
 1.4% growth in 1994, with 3% growth expected in 1995 and 1996. This
 comeback rests on high levels of public investment, continuing strong
 export growth, and a gradual recovery in consumer spending. The
 government's long-run economic goal is the modernization of Portuguese
 markets, industry, infrastructure, and work force in order to catch up
 with productivity and income levels of the more advanced EU countries.
 Per capita income now equals only 55% of the EU average. Economic
 policy in 1994 focused on reducing inflationary pressures by lowering
 the fiscal deficit, maintaining a stable escudo, moderating wage
 increases, and encouraging increased competition. The government's
 medium-term objective is to be in the first tier of the EU countries
 eligible to join the economic and monetary union (EMU) as early as
 1997. To this end, the 1995 budget posits a cut in total deficit to
 5.8% of GDP.

@Puerto Rico:Economy

 Overview: Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the
 Caribbean region. Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary
 sector of economic activity and income. Encouraged by duty free access
 to the US and by tax incentives, US firms have invested heavily in
 Puerto Rico since the 1950s. US minimum wage laws apply. Important
 industries include pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles,
 petrochemicals, and processed foods. Sugar production has lost out to
 dairy production and other livestock products as the main source of
 income in the agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an
 important source of income for the island, with estimated arrivals of
 nearly 3.9 million tourists in 1993.

 Overview: Oil is the backbone of the economy and accounts for more
 than 30% of GDP, roughly 75% of export earnings, and 70% of government

 industrial countries. Production and export of natural gas are
 becoming increasingly important. Long-term goals feature the
 development of off-shore oil and the diversification of the economy.

@Reunion:Economy

 Overview: The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture.
 Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a century, and in
 some years it accounts for 85% of exports. The government has been
 pushing the development of a tourist industry to relieve high
 unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third of the labor force.
 The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is extraordinary
 and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The white and Indian
 communities are substantially better off than other segments of the
 population, often approaching European standards, whereas indigenous
 groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer
 nations of the African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in
 February 1991 illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions.
 The economic well-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued
 financial assistance from France.

@Romania:Economy

 Overview: Despite the continuing difficulties in moving away from the
 former command system, the Romanian economy seems to have bottomed out
 in 1993-94. Market oriented reforms have been introduced fitfully
 since the downfall of CEAUSESCU in December 1989, with the result a
 growing private sector, especially in services. The slow pace of
 structural reform, however, has exacerbated Romania's high inflation
 rate and eroded real wages. Agricultural production rebounded in 1993
 from the drought-reduced harvest of 1992. The economy continued its
 recovery in 1994, further gains being realized in agriculture,
 construction, services, and trade. Food supplies are adequate but
 expensive. Romania's infrastructure had deteriorated over the last
 five years due to reduced levels of public investment. Residents of
 the capital reported frequent disruptions of heating and water
 services. The slow and painful process of conversion to a more open
 economy will continue in 1995.
