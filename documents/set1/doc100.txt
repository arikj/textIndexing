@Tajikistan, Economy

Overview: 
  Tajikistan had the lowest per capita GDP in the former USSR, the
  highest rate of population growth, and the lowest standard of living.
  Its economy at the start of 1994 is producing at roughly the 1989
  level and faces urgent reconstruction tasks from the 1992 civil war.
  Tajikistan's economy was severely disrupted by the breakup of the
  Soviet economy, which provided guaranteed trade relations and heavy
  subsidies and in which specialized tasks were assigned to each
  republic. Its economy is highly agricultural (43% of the work force);
  it has specialized in growing cotton for export and must import a
  large share of its food. Its industry (14% of the work force) produces
  aluminum, hydropower, machinery, and household appliances. Nearly all
  petroleum products must be imported. Constant political turmoil and
  continued dominance of former Communist officials have slowed the
  process of economic reform and brought near economic collapse while
  limiting foreign assistance. Tajikistan is in the midst of a prolonged
  monetary crisis in which it is attempting to continue to use the
  Russian ruble as its currency while its neighbors have switched to new
  independent currencies; Russia is unwilling to advance sufficient
  rubles without attaching stringent reform conditions.
National product: 
  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $6.9 billion (1993 estimate from
  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and
  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993; and as
  extrapolated to 1993 using official Tajik statistics, which are very
  uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)
National product real growth rate: 
  -21% (1993 est.)
National product per capita: 
  $1,180 (1993 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices): 
  38% per month (1993 average)
Unemployment rate:

@Tanzania, Economy

Overview: 
  Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. The economy is
  heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 58% of GDP,
  provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Industry
  accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing
  agricultural products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery
  program announced in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in
  agricultural production and financial support for the program by
  bilateral donors. The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and
  bilateral donors have provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's
  deteriorated economic infrastructure. Growth in 1991-93 featured a
  pickup in industrial production and a substantial increase in output
  of minerals led by gold.

@Thailand, Economy

Overview: 
  Thailand's economy recovered rapidly from the political unrest in May
  1992 to post an impressive 7.5% growth rate for the year and 7.8% in
  1993. One of the more advanced developing countries in Asia, Thailand
  depends on exports of manufactures and the development of the service
  sector to fuel the country's rapid growth. The trade and current
  account deficits fell in 1992; much of Thailand's recent imports have
  been for capital equipment suggesting that the export sector is poised
  for further growth. With foreign investment slowing, Bangkok is
  working to increase the generation of domestic capital. Prime Minister
  CHUAN's government - Thailand's fifth government in less than two
  years - is pledged to continue Bangkok's probusiness policies, and the
  return of a democratically elected government has improved business
  confidence. Nevertheless, CHUAN must overcome divisions within his
  ruling coalition to complete much needed infrastructure development
  programs if Thailand is to remain an attractive place for business
  investment. Over the longer-term, Bangkok must produce more college
  graduates with technical training and upgrade workers' skills to
  continue its rapid economic development.

@The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Economy

Overview: 
  The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, although the poorest
  republic in the former Yugoslav federation, can meet basic food and
  energy needs through its own agricultural and coal resources. Its
  economic decline will continue unless ties are reforged or enlarged
  with its neighbors Serbia and Montenegro, Albania, Greece, and
  Bulgaria. The economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil
  and gas and its modern machinery and parts. Continued political
  turmoil, both internally and in the region as a whole, prevents any
  swift readjustments of trade patterns and economic programs. The
  country's industrial output and GDP are expected to decline further in
  1994. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's geographical
  isolation, technological backwardness, and potential political
  instability place it far down the list of countries of interest to
  Western investors. Resolution of the dispute with Greece and an
  internal commitment to economic reform would help to encourage foreign
  investment over the long run. In the immediate future, the worst
  scenario for the economy would be the spread of fighting across its
  borders.

@Togo, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture, which
  accounts for about 33% of GDP and provides employment for 78% of the
  labor force. Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coffee, and
  cotton, which together generate about 30% of total export earnings.
  Togo is self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal.
  In the industrial sector phosphate mining is by far the most important
  activity, although it has suffered from the collapse of World
  phosphate prices and increased foreign competition. Togo serves as a
  regional commercial and trade center. The government's decade-long IMF
  and World Bank supported effort to implement economic reform measures
  to encourage foreign investment and bring revenues in line with
  expenditures has stalled. Political unrest, including private and
  public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, has jeopardized the
  reform program and has disrupted vital economic activity.
