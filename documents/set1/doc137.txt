@Northern Mariana Islands:Economy

 Overview: The economy benefits substantially from financial assistance
 from the US. The rate of funding has declined as locally generated
 government revenues have grown. An agreement for the years 1986 to
 1992 entitled the islands to $228 million for capital development,
 government operations, and special programs. A rapidly growing major
 source of income is the tourist industry, which now employs about 50%
 of the work force. Japanese tourists predominate. The agricultural
 sector is of minor importance and is made up of cattle ranches and
 small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons.
 Industry is small scale, mostly handicrafts, light manufacturing, and
 garment production.

@Norway:Economy

 Overview: Norway has a mixed economy involving a combination of free
 market activity and government intervention. The government controls
 key areas, such as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale
 state enterprises) and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing,
 and areas with sparse resources. Norway also maintains an extensive
 welfare system that helps propel public sector expenditures to
 slightly more than 50% of the GDP and results in one of the highest
 average tax burdens in the world (54%). A small country with a high
 dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an exporter of
 raw materials and semiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small- and
 medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations.
 The country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum,
 hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on
 its oil sector to keep its economy afloat. Norway imports more than
 half its food needs. Although one of the government's main priorities
 is to reduce this dependency, this situation is not likely to improve
 for years to come. The government also hopes to reduce unemployment
 and strengthen and diversify the economy through tax reform and a
 series of expansionary budgets. The budget deficit is expected to hit
 a record 8% of GDP because of welfare spending and bail-outs of the
 banking system. Unemployment is currently running at 8.4% - including
 those in job programs - because of the weakness of the economy outside
 the oil sector. Economic growth, only 1.6% in 1993, moved up to 5.5%
 in 1994. Oslo opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in
 November 1994.

@Oman:Economy

 Overview: Economic performance is closely tied to the fortunes of the
 oil industry, including trends in international oil prices and the
 ability of OPEC producers to agree on output quotas. Petroleum
 accounts for more than 85% of export earnings, about 80% of government
 revenues, and roughly 40% of GDP. Oman has proved oil reserves of 4
 billion barrels, equivalent to about 20 years' supply at the current
 rate of extraction. Agriculture is carried on at a subsistence level
 and the general population depends on imported food. The government is
 encouraging private investment, both domestic and foreign, as a prime
 force for further economic development.

PACIFIC OCEAN

@Pacific Ocean:Geography

 Location: body of water between Antarctica, Asia, Australia, and the
 Western Hemisphere

 Map references: World

 Area:
 total area: 165.384 million sq km
 comparative area: about 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean
 (followed by the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic
 Ocean); covers about one-third of the global surface; larger than the
 total land area of the world
 note: includes Bali Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering Sea, Bering
 Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Flores Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of
 Tonkin, Java Sea, Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Savu Sea, Sea of Japan,
 Sea of Okhotsk, South China Sea, Tasman Sea, Timor Sea, and other
 tributary water bodies

 Coastline: 135,663 km

 International disputes: some maritime disputes (see littoral states)

 Climate: the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy season occurs
 during the summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the
 ocean over the land, and a dry season during the winter months, when
 dry winds blow from the Asian land mass back to the ocean

 Terrain: surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a
 clockwise, warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in
 the southern Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the
 northern Pacific sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk in
 winter; in the southern Pacific sea ice from Antarctica reaches its
 northernmost extent in October; the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific
 is dominated by the East Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is
 dissected by deep trenches, including the world's deepest, the 10,924
 meter Marianas Trench

 Natural resources: oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and
 gravel aggregates, placer deposits, fish

 Environment:
 current issues: endangered marine species include the dugong, sea
 lion, sea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution in
 Philippine Sea and South China Sea
 natural hazards: surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and
 earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire;
 subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east Asia
 from May to December (most frequent from July to October); tropical
 cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike Central
 America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August and
 September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from
 Antarctica; occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru
 when the trade winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent
 moves south, killing the plankton that is the primary food source for
 anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move to better feeding grounds,
 causing resident marine birds to starve by the thousands because of
 their lost food source; ships subject to superstructure icing in
 extreme north from October to May and in extreme south from May to
 October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific can be a maritime
 hazard from June to December
 international agreements: NA

 Note: the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal,
 Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the
 Pacific Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific
 Ocean; dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in
 the southwestern Pacific Ocean

@Pacific Ocean:Economy

 Overview: The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world
 economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly touch.
 It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West,
 extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and
 sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%)
 of the world's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the
 only ocean where the fish catch has increased every year since 1978.
 Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an
 ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of Australia, NZ, China,
 US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas,
 combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has
 slowed but not stopped new drillings.

 Industries: fishing, oil and gas production

@Pakistan:Economy

 Overview: The Pakistani economy has made progress in several key areas
 since Benazir BHUTTO became Prime Minister in October 1993. She has
 been under pressure from international donors and the IMF - which gave
 Pakistan a $1.3 billion structural adjustment credit in February 1994
 - to continue the economic reforms and austerity measures begun by her
 predecessor, caretaker Prime Minister Moeen QURESHI (July-October
 1993). Foreign exchange reserves climbed to more than $3 billion in
 1994, and the budget deficit was substantially reduced. Real GDP
 growth was 4% in FY93/94, up from 2.3% in FY92/93. Foreign direct and
 portfolio investment also have increased. Privatization of large
 public sector utilities began in 1994 with the sale of 12% of the
 Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) and the Water and Power
 Development Authority (WAPDA); the sale of state-owned banks and other
 large units are planned for 1995. Still, the government must cope with
 long-standing economic vulnerabilities - high levels of debt service
 and defense spending, a small tax base, a huge population, and
 dependence on cotton-based exports - which hamper its ability to
 create a stable economic environment. In addition, Pakistan's
 infrastructure is inadequate and deteriorating, low levels of literacy
 constrain industrial growth, and increasing sectarian, ethnic, and
 tribal violence disrupt production.

@Palau:Economy

 Overview: The economy consists primarily of subsistence agriculture
 and fishing. The government is the major employer of the work force,
 relying heavily on financial assistance from the US. The compact of
 "free association" with the United States, entered into after the end
 of the UN trusteeship on 1 October 1994, provides Palau with $500
 million in US aid over 15 years in return for furnishing some military
 facilities. The population, in effect, enjoys a per capita income of
 $5,000, twice that of the Philippines and much of Micronesia. Long-run
 prospects for the tourist sector have been greatly bolstered by the
 expansion of air travel in the Pacific and the rapidly rising
 prosperity of leading East Asian countries.
