@Cote D'ivoire:Economy

 Overview: Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers and
 exporters of coffee, cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently,
 the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international
 prices for coffee and cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite
 attempts by the government to diversify, the economy is still largely
 dependent on agriculture and related industries. After several years
 of lagging performance, the Ivorian economy began a comeback in 1994,
 due to improved prices for cocoa and coffee, growth in non-traditional
 primary exports such as pineapples and rubber, trade and banking
 liberalization, offshore oil and gas discoveries, and generous
 external financing and debt rescheduling by multilateral lenders and
 France. The 50% devaluation in January 1994 caused a one time jump in
 the inflation rate. Government adherence to a renewed structural
 adjustment program has led to a budget surplus for the first time in
 several years, a smaller personnel budget, and an increase in public
 investment. While real growth in 1994 was only 1.5%, the IMF and World
 Bank expect it will surpass 6% in 1995.

@Croatia:Economy

 Overview: Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic of
 Croatia, after Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized
 area, with a per capita output perhaps one-third above the Yugoslav
 average. At present, Croatian Serb Separatists control approximately
 one-third of the Croatian territory, and one of the overriding
 determinants of Croatia's long-term political and economic prospects
 will be the resolution of this territorial dispute. Croatia faces
 serious economic problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime
 Communist mismanagement of the economy; large foreign debt; damage
 during the fighting to bridges, factories, power lines, buildings, and
 houses; the large refugee population, both Croatian and Bosnian; and
 the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former
 Yugoslav republics, as well as within its own territory. At the
 minimum, extensive Western aid and investment, especially in the
 tourist and oil industries, would seem necessary to revive the
 moribund economy. However, peace and political stability must come
 first; only then will recent government moves toward a
 "market-friendly" economy restore old levels of output. As of February
 1995, fighting continues among Croats, Serbs, and Muslims, and
 national boundaries and final political arrangements are still in
 doubt.

@Cuba:Economy

 Overview: Cuba's heavily statist economy remains severely depressed as
 the result of its own inefficiencies and the loss of massive amounts
 of economic aid from the former Soviet Bloc. Total output in 1994 was
 only about half the output of 1989. The fall in output and in imports
 is reflected in the deterioration of food supplies, shortages of
 electricity, inability to get spare parts, and the replacement of
 motor-driven vehicles by bicycles and draft animals. Higher world
 market prices for sugar and nickel in 1994, however, resulted in a
 slight increase in export earnings for the first time in six years,
 despite lower production of both commodities. The growth of tourism
 slowed in late 1994 as a result of negative publicity surrounding the
 exodus of Cubans from the island and other international factors. The
 government continued its aggressive search for foreign investment and
 announced preliminary agreements to form large joint ventures with
 Mexican investors in telecommunications and oil refining. In mid-1994,
 the National Assembly began introducing several new taxes and price
 increases to stem growing excess liquidity and restore some of the
 peso's value as a monetary instrument. In October the government
 attempted to stimulate food production by permitting the sale of any
 surplus production (over state quotas) at unrestricted prices at
 designated markets. Similar but much smaller markets were also
 introduced for the sale of manufactured goods in December. The various
 government measures have influenced a remarkable appreciation of the
 black market value of the peso, from more than 100 pesos to the dollar
 in September 1994 to 40 pesos to the dollar in early 1995. Policy
 discussions continue in the bureaucracy over the proper pace and scope
 of economic reform.

@Cyprus:Economy

 Overview: The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and
 prosperous. Industry contributes 14% to GDP and employs 29% of the
 labor force, while the service sector contributes 53% to GDP and
 employs 57% of the labor force. An average 6.8% rise in real GDP
 between 1986 and 1990 was temporarily checked in 1991, because of the
 adverse effects of the Gulf war on tourism. After surging 8.5% in
 1992, growth slowed to 2.0% in 1993 - its lowest level in two decades
 - because of the decline in tourist arrivals associated with the
 recession in Western Europe, Cyprus' main trading partner, and the
 loss in export competitiveness due to a sharp rise in unit labor
 costs. Real GDP is likely to have picked up in 1994, and inflation is
 estimated to have risen to between 5% and 6%. The Turkish Cypriot
 economy has less than one-third the per capita GDP of the south.
 Because it is recognized only by Turkey, it has had much difficulty
 arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to
 invest there. The economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture,
 which employs one-quarter of the work force. Moreover, because the
 Turkish lira is legal tender, the Turkish Cypriot economy has suffered
 the same high inflation as mainland Turkey. The small, vulnerable
 economy is estimated to have experienced a sharp drop in growth during
 1994 because of the severe economic crisis affecting the mainland. To
 compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey provides direct and
 indirect aid to nearly every sector; financial support has risen in
 value to about one-third of Turkish Cypriot GDP.

@Czech Republic:Economy

 Overview: The government of the Czech Republic, using successful
 stabilization policies to bolster its claims to full membership in the
 western economic community, has reduced inflation to 10%, kept
 unemployment at 3%, balanced the budget, run trade surpluses, and
 reoriented exports to the EU since the breakup of the Czechoslovak
 federation on 1 January 1993. GDP grew 2% in 1994 after stagnating in
 1993 and contracting nearly 20% since 1990. Prague's mass
 privatization program, including its innovative distribution of
 ownership shares to Czech citizens via 'coupon vouchers,' has made the
 most rapid progress in Eastern Europe. When coupon shares are
 distributed in early 1995, 75%-80% of the economy will be in private
 hands or partially privatized, according to the Czech government.
 Privatized companies still face major problems in restructuring; the
 number of annual bankruptcies quadrupled in 1994. In September 1994,
 Prague repaid $471 million in IMF loans five years ahead of schedule,
 making the Czech Republic the first East European country to pay off
 all IMF debts. Despite these outlays, hard-currency reserves in the
 banking system totaled more than $8.5 billion in October. Standard &
 Poor's boosted the Republic's credit rating to BBB+ in mid-1994 - up
 from a BBB rating that was already two steps higher than Hungary's and
 one step above Greece's rating. Prague forecasts a balanced budget, at
 least 3% GDP growth, 5% unemployment, and single-digit inflation for
 1995. Inflationary pressures - primarily as a result of foreign bank
 lending to Czech enterprises but perhaps also due to eased currency
 convertibility controls - are likely to be the most troublesome issues
 in 1995. Continuing economic recovery in Western Europe should boost
 Czech exports and production but a substantial increase in prices
 could erode the Republic's comparative advantage in low wages and
 exchange rates. Prague already took steps in 1994 to increase control
 over banking policies to neutralize the impact of foreign inflows on
 the money supply. Although Czech unemployment is currently the lowest
 in Central Europe, it will probably increase 1-2 percentage points in
 1995 as large state firms go bankrupt or are restructured and service
 sector growth slows.
