@Svalbard, Economy

Overview: 
  Coal mining is the major economic activity on Svalbard. By treaty (9
  February 1920), the nationals of the treaty powers have equal rights
  to exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation. Although
  US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the
  only companies still mining are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements
  on Svalbard are essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned
  coal company employs nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the
  island, runs many of the local services, and provides most of the
  local infrastructure. There is also some trapping of seal, polar bear,
  fox, and walrus.

@Swaziland, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which occupies more
  than 60% of the population and contributes nearly 25% to GDP.
  Manufacturing, which includes a number of agroprocessing factories,
  accounts for another quarter of GDP. Mining has declined in importance
  in recent years; high-grade iron ore deposits were depleted in 1978,
  and health concerns cut world demand for asbestos. Exports of sugar
  and forestry products are the main earners of hard currency.
  Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with Mozambique,
  Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it receives
  90% of its imports and to which it sends about half of its exports.

@Sweden, Economy

Overview: 
  Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World War I
  through World War II, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of
  living under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive
  welfare benefits. It has a modern distribution system, excellent
  internal and external communications, and a skilled labor force.
  Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an
  economy that is heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned
  firms account for about 90% of industrial output, of which the
  engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. In the last
  few years, however, this extraordinarily favorable picture has been
  clouded by inflation, growing unemployment, and a gradual loss of
  competitiveness in international markets. Although Prime Minister
  BILDT's center-right minority coalition had hoped to charge ahead with
  free-market-oriented reforms, a skyrocketing budget deficit - almost
  14% of GDP in FY94 projections - and record unemployment have
  forestalled many of the plans. Unemployment in 1993 is estimated at
  around 8% with another 5% in job training. Continued heavy foreign
  exchange speculation forced the government to cooperate in late 1992
  with the opposition Social Democrats on two crisis packages - one a
  severe austerity pact and the other a program to spur industrial
  competitiveness - which basically set economic policy through 1997. In
  November 1992, Sweden broke its tie to the EC's ECU, and the krona has
  since depreciated about 25% against the dollar. The government hopes
  the boost in export competitiveness from the depreciation will help
  lift Sweden out of its 3-year recession. To curb the budget deficit
  and bolster confidence in the economy, BILDT continues to propose cuts
  in welfare benefits, subsidies, defense, and foreign aid. Sweden
  continues to harmonize its economic policies with those of the EU in
  preparation for scheduled membership by early 1995, which will help to
  broaden European economic unity.

@Switzerland, Economy

Overview: 
  Switzerland's economy - one of the most prosperous and stable in the
  world - is nonetheless undergoing a painful adjustment after both the
  inflationary boom of the late-1980s and the electorate's rejection of
  membership in the European Economic Area in 1992. The Swiss finally
  emerged from a three-year recession in mid-1993 and posted a -0.6% GDP
  growth for the year. After a three-year struggle with inflation, the
  Swiss central bank's tight monetary policies have begun to pay off.
  Inflation slowed to 3.3% in 1993 from about 4% in 1992 and is expected
  to slow down further to 1.5% in 1994. Unemployment, however, will
  continue to be a problem over the near term. Swiss unemployment
  reached 5.1% in 1993 and will likely remain at that level through 1994
  before declining in 1995. The voters' rejection of a referendum on
  membership in the EEA, which was supported by most political,
  business, and financial leaders has raised doubts that the country can
  maintain its preeminent prosperity and leadership in commercial
  banking in the twenty-first century. Despite these problems, Swiss per
  capita output, general living standards, education and science, health
  care, and diet remain unsurpassed in Europe. The country has few
  natural resources except for the scenic natural beauty that has made
  it a world leader in tourism. Management-labor relations remain
  generally harmonious.

@Syria, Economy

Overview: 
  Syria's state-dominated Ba'thist economy has benefited from the Gulf
  war of early 1991, increased oil production, good weather, and
  economic deregulation. Economic growth averaged roughly 10% in
  1990-93. The Gulf war provided Syria an aid windfall of nearly $5
  billion dollars from Arab, European, and Japanese donors. These
  inflows more than offset Damascus's war-related costs and will help
  Syria cover some of its debt arrears, restore suspended credit lines,
  and initiate selected military and civilian purchases. In 1992 the
  government spurred economic development by loosening controls on
  domestic and foreign investment while maintaining strict political
  controls. For the long run, Syria's economy is still saddled with a
  large number of poorly performing public sector firms, and industrial
  productivity remains to be improved. Another major long-term concern
  is the additional drain of upstream Euphrates water by Turkey when its
  vast dam and irrigation projects are completed by mid-decade.

@Taiwan, Economy

Overview: 
  Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with considerable government
  guidance of investment and foreign trade and partial government
  ownership of some large banks and industrial firms. Real growth in GNP
  has averaged about 9% a year during the past three decades. Export
  growth has been even faster and has provided the impetus for
  industrialization. Agriculture contributes about 4% to GDP, down from
  35% in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13 among major trading
  countries. Traditional labor-intensive industries are steadily being
  replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive industries.
  Taiwan has become a major investor in China, Thailand, Indonesia, the
  Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The tightening of labor markets
  has led to an influx of foreign workers, both legal and illegal.
