@Liechtenstein, Economy

Overview: 
  The prosperous economy is based primarily on small-scale light
  industry and tourism. Industry accounts for 53% of total employment,
  the service sector 45% (mostly based on tourism), and agriculture and
  forestry 2%. The sale of postage stamps to collectors is estimated at
  $10 million annually. Low business taxes (the maximum tax rate is 20%)
  and easy incorporation rules have induced about 25,000 holding or
  so-called letter box companies to establish nominal offices in
  Liechtenstein. Such companies, incorporated solely for tax purposes,
  provide 30% of state revenues. The economy is tied closely to
  Switzerland's economy in a customs union, and incomes and living
  standards parallel those of the more prosperous Swiss groups.

@Lithuania, Economy

Overview: 
  Since independence in September 1991, Lithuania has made steady
  progress in developing a market economy. Over 40% of state property
  has been privatized and trade is diversifying with a gradual shift
  away from the former Soviet Union to Western markets. Nevertheless,
  the process has been painful with industrial output in 1993 less than
  half the 1991 level. Inflation, while lower than in most ex-Soviet
  states, has exceeded rates in the other Baltic states. Full monetary
  stability and economic recovery are likely to be impeded by periodic
  government backtracking on key elements of its reform and
  stabilization program as it seeks to ease the economic pain of
  restructuring. Recovery will build on Lithuanian's strategic location
  with its ice-free port at Klaipeda and its rail and highway hub in
  Vilnius connecting it with Eastern Europe, Belarus, Russia, and
  Ukraine, and on its agriculture potential, highly skilled labor force,
  and diversified industrial sector. Lacking important natural
  resources, it will remain dependent on imports of fuels and raw
  materials.
National product: 
  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $12.4 billion (1993 estimate from
  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and
  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993; and as
  extrapolated to 1993 using official Lithuanian statistics, which are
  very uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)

@Luxembourg, Economy

Overview: 
  The stable, prosperous economy features moderate growth, low
  inflation, and negligible unemployment. Agriculture is based on small
  but highly productive family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until
  recently dominated by steel, has become increasingly more diversified,
  particularly toward high-technology firms. During the past decade,
  growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the
  decline in steel. Services, especially banking, account for a growing
  proportion of the economy. Luxembourg participates in an economic
  union with Belgium on trade and most financial matters, is also
  closely connected economically to the Netherlands, and as a member of
  the 12-member European Union enjoys the advantages of the open
  European market.

  clothing industry has provided about two-thirds of export earnings;
  the gambling industry represented well over 40% of GDP in 1992. Macau

@Madagascar, Economy

Overview: 
  Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. Agriculture,
  including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy,
  accounting for over 30% of GDP and contributing more than 70% of total
  export earnings. Industry is largely confined to the processing of
  agricultural products and textile manufacturing; in 1991 it accounted
  for only 13% of GDP. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year
  development plan that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice)
  by 1990, increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports.
  Subsequently, growth in output has been held back because of
  protracted antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political
  reform.

@Malaysia, Economy

Overview: 
  The Malaysian economy, a mixture of private enterprise and a soundly
  managed public sector, has posted a remarkable record of 8%-9% average
  growth in 1987-93. This growth has resulted in a substantial reduction
  in poverty and a marked rise in real wages. Despite sluggish growth in
  the major world economies in 1992-93, demand for Malaysian goods
  remained strong, and foreign investors continued to commit large sums
  in the economy. The government is aware of the inflationary potential
  of this rapid development and is closely monitoring fiscal and
  monetary policies.
