Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based on family and corporate
agriculture, which accounts for 25% of GDP, employs about 60% of the
labor force, and supplies two-thirds of exports. Manufacturing and
construction, predominantly in private hands, account for about 20% of
GDP and 18% of the labor force. In both 1990 and 1991, the economy
grew by 3%, the fourth and fifth consecutive years of mild growth. In
1992 growth picked up to almost 5% as government policies favoring
competition and foreign trade and investment took stronger hold. In
1993-94, despite political unrest, this momentum continued, foreign
investment held up, and annual growth averaged 4%. Strong
international prices for Guatemala's traditional commodity exports
featured 4.9% growth in 1995; growth receded to 3% in 1996. Given the
markedly uneven distribution of land and income, the government faces
major obstacles in its program of economic modernization and the
reduction of poverty.

Economy

Economy - overview: Although possessing major mineral, hydropower, and
agricultural resources, Guinea remains one of the poorest countries in
the world. The agricultural sector employs 80% of the work force.
Guinea possesses over 25% of the world's bauxite reserves and is the
second largest bauxite producer. The mining sector accounted for about
75% of exports in 1995. Long run improvements in government fiscal
arrangements, literacy, and the legal framework are needed if the
country is to move out of poverty. Except in the mining industry,
foreign investment remains minimal.

Economy

Economy - overview: Guinea-Bissau ranks among the poorest countries in
the world. Farming and fishing are the main economic activities.
Cashew nuts, peanuts, palm kernels, and fish are the primary exports.
Exploitation of known mineral deposits is unlikely at present because
of a weak infrastructure and the high cost of development. Although
Guinea-Bissau won an IMF Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility in
1996, recent political instability and overspending have undermined
the progress of economic reform and delayed disbursements of donor
aid.

Economy - overview: In 1996, Guyana, one of the poorest countries in
the Western Hemisphere, posted its fifth straight year of economic
growth of 5% or better, with the advance led by gold and bauxite
mining and by sugar. Favorable growth factors have included expansion
in the key agricultural and mining sectors, a more favorable
atmosphere for business initiative, a more realistic exchange rate, a
moderate inflation rate, and the continued support of international
organizations. Serious underlying economic problems will continue.
Electric power has been in short supply and constitutes a major
barrier to future gains in national output. The government must
persist in efforts to manage its sizable external debt and extend its
privatization program.

Economy

Economy - overview: About 75% of the population lives in abject
poverty. Nearly 70% of all Haitians depend on the agriculture sector,
which consists mainly of small-scale subsistence farming and employs
about two-thirds of the economically active work force. The country
has experienced little or no job creation since President PREVAL took
office in February 1996. Failure to reach agreements with
international sponsors have denied Haiti badly needed budget and
development assistance. Meeting aid conditions in 1997 will be
especially challenging in the face of mounting popular criticism of
reforms.
