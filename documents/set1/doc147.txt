@Uganda:Economy

 Overview: Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile
 soils, regular rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and
 cobalt. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy,
 employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export crop
 and accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the
 government - with the support of foreign countries and international
 agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by
 undertaking currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops,
 increasing prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service
 wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation
 and boosting production and export earnings. In 1990-94, the economy
 turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the
 rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production
 and exports, and gradually improving domestic security. The economy
 again prospered in 1994 with rapid growth, low inflation, growing
 foreign investment, a trimmed bureaucracy, and the continued return of
 exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs.

@Ukraine:Economy

 Overview: After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and away the
 most important economic component of the former Soviet Union,
 producing more than three times the output of the next-ranking
 republic. Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of
 Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial
 quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics.
 Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw
 materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the
 former USSR. In early 1992, the Ukrainian government liberalized most
 prices and erected a legal framework for privatization, but widespread
 resistance to reform within the government and the legislature soon
 stalled reform efforts and led to some backtracking. Loose monetary
 and fiscal policies pushed inflation to hyperinflationary levels in
 late 1993. Greater monetary and fiscal restraint lowered inflation in
 1994, but also contributed to an accelerated decline in industrial
 output. Since his election in July 1994, President KUCHMA has
 developed - and parliament has approved - a comprehensive economic
 reform program, maintained financial discipline, and reduced state
 controls over prices, the exchange rate, and foreign trade.
 Implementation of KUCHMA's economic agenda will encounter considerable
 resistance from parliament, entrenched bureaucrats, and industrial
 interests and will contribute to further declines in output and rising
 unemployment which will sorely test the government's ability to stay
 the course on reform in 1995.

@United Arab Emirates:Economy

 Overview: The UAE has an open economy with one of the world's highest
 incomes per capita and with a sizable annual trade surplus. Its wealth
 is based on oil and gas output (about 40% of GDP), and the fortunes of
 the economy fluctuate with the prices of those commodities. Since
 1973, the UAE has undergone a profound transformation from an
 impoverished region of small desert principalities to a modern state
 with a high standard of living. At present levels of production, crude
 oil reserves should last for over 100 years. Although much stronger
 economically than most Gulf states, the UAE faces similar problems
 with weak international oil prices and the pressures for cuts in OPEC
 oil production quotas. The UAE government is encouraging increased
 privatization within the economy.

@United Kingdom:Economy

 Overview: The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and
 financial centers, and its economy ranks among the four largest in
 Western Europe. The economy is essentially capitalistic; over the past
 13 years the ruling Tories have greatly reduced public ownership and
 contained the growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is
 intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards,
 producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor force. The
 UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves, and primary energy
 production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any
 industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and
 business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP
 while industry continues to decline in importance, now employing only
 25% of the work force and generating only 21% of GDP. The economy
 registered 4.2% GDP growth in 1994, its fastest annual rate for six
 years. Exports and manufacturing output are the primary engines of
 growth. Unemployment is gradually falling. Inflation is at the lowest
 level in 27 years, but British monetary authorities raised interest
 rates to 6.25% in 1994 in a preemptive strike on emerging inflationary
 pressures such as higher taxes and rising manufacturing costs. The
 combination of a buoyant economy and fiscal tightening is projected to
 trim the FY94/95 budget shortfall to about $50 billion - down from
 about $75 billion in FY93/94. The major economic policy question for
 Britain in the 1990s is the terms on which it participates in the
 financial and economic integration of Europe.

@United States:Economy

 Overview: The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologically
 advanced economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $25,850, the
 largest among major industrial nations. The economy is market oriented
 with most decisions made by private individuals and business firms and
 with government purchases of goods and services made predominantly in
 the marketplace. In 1989 the economy enjoyed its seventh successive
 year of substantial growth, the longest in peacetime history. The
 expansion featured moderation in wage and consumer price increases and
 a steady reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of the labor force. In
 1990, however, growth slowed to 1% because of a combination of
 factors, such as the worldwide increase in interest rates, Iraq's
 invasion of Kuwait in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and
 a general decline in business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output
 fell by 0.6%, unemployment grew, and signs of recovery proved
 premature. Growth picked up to 2.3% in 1992 and to 3.1% in 1993.
 Unemployment, however, declined only gradually, the increase in GDP
 being mainly attributable to gains in output per worker. The year 1994
 witnessed a solid 4% gain in real output, a low inflation rate of
 2.6%, and a drop in unemployment below 6%. The capture of both houses
 of Congress by the Republicans in the elections of 8 November 1994
 means substantial changes are likely in US economic policy, including
 changes in the ways the US will address its major economic problems in
 1995-96. These problems include inadequate investment in economic
 infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs of an aging population,
 and sizable budget and trade deficits.

@Uruguay:Economy

 Overview: Uruguay's economy is a small one with favorable climate,
 good soils, and substantial hydropower potential. Economic development
 has been restrained in recent years by excessive government regulation
 of economic detail and 40% to 130% inflation. Although the GDP growth
 rate slowed in 1993 to 1.7%, following a healthy expansion to 7.5% in
 1992, it rebounded in 1994 to an estimated 4%, spurred mostly by
 increasing agricultural and other exports and a surprise reversal of
 the downward trend in industrial production. In a major step toward
 regional economic cooperation, Uruguay confirmed its commitment to the
 Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) customs union by implementing
 MERCOSUR's common external tariff on most tradables on 1 January 1995.
 Inflation in 1994 declined for the third consecutive year, yet, at
 44%, it remains the highest in the region; analysts predict that the
 expanding fiscal deficit and wage indexation will force the inflation
 rate back toward the 50% mark in 1995.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $23 billion (1994
 est.)

 National product real growth rate: 4% (1994 est.)

 Inflation rate (consumer prices): 44% (1994 est.)

 million (1991 est.)

 Exports: $1.78 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)
 commodities: wool and textile manufactures, beef and other animal
 products, leather, rice
