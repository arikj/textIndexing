state-owned Malta drydocks employs about 3,800 people. In 1995, over
1.1 million tourists visited the island. Per capita GDP of $12,600
places Malta in the range of the less affluent EU countries. The
island is divided politically over the question of joining the EU.

Economy

Economy - overview: Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are
key sectors of the economy. The government's policy of offering
incentives to high-technology companies and financial institutions to
locate on the island has paid off in expanding employment
opportunities in high-income industries. As a result, agriculture and
fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in their
shares of GDP. Banking now contributes about 45% to GDP. Trade is
mostly with the UK. The Isle of Man enjoys free access to EU markets.

Economy

Economy - overview: Agriculture and tourism are the mainstays of the
economy. Agricultural production is concentrated on small farms, and
the most important commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons,
and breadfruit. Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, fish
processing, and copra. The tourist industry is the primary source of
foreign exchange, employs about 10% of the labor force, and remains
the best hope for future added income. The islands have few natural
resources, and imports far exceed exports. The government is drafting
economic reforms designed to increase revenue and compensate for
reductions in US Government grants - in 1994, the US Government
provided grants of $50 million, equal to 55% of the Marshall Islands'
GDP. About 25% of the government's FY95/96 budget was devoted to debt
repayment. In 1996, efforts to stabilize the economy included a 27%
reduction in the government's work force and a 10% cut in the budget.

Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas,
tourism, and light industry. Agriculture accounts for about 6% of GDP
and the small industrial sector for 11%. Sugar production has
declined, with most of the sugarcane now used for the production of
rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk
of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported,
contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than
agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of
the work force is employed in the service sector and in
administration.

Economy

Economy - overview: A majority of the population still depends on
agriculture and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the
nomads and many subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by
recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania has extensive
deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports.
The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks
in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest
fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners
threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater
port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, drought and
economic mismanagement have resulted in a substantial buildup of
foreign debt. The government has begun the second stage of an economic
reform program in consultation with the World Bank, the IMF, and major
donor countries. Short-term growth prospects are gloomy because of the
heavy debt service burden, rapid population growth, and vulnerability
to climatic conditions.
