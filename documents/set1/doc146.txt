 high per capita income by Latin American standards, even though output
 and living standards are substantially below the boom years of

@Tunisia:Economy

 Overview: Tunisia has a diverse economy, with important agricultural,
 mining, energy, tourism, and manufacturing sectors. Detailed
 governmental control of economic affairs has gradually lessened over
 the past decade, including increasing privatization of trade and
 commerce, simplification of the tax structure, and a cautious approach
 to debt. Real growth has averaged roughly 5% in 1991-94, and inflation
 has been moderate. Growth in tourism and IMF support have been key
 elements in this solid record. Further privatization and further
 improvements in government administrative efficiency are among the
 challenges for the future.

@Turkey:Economy

 Overview: In early 1995, after an impressive economic performance
 through most of the 1980s, Turkey continues to suffer through its most
 damaging economic crisis in the last 15 years. Sparked by the
 downgrading in January 1994 of Turkey's international credit rating by
 two US credit rating agencies, the crisis stems from years of loose
 fiscal and monetary policies that had exacerbated inflation and
 allowed the public debt, money supply, and current account deficit to
 explode. In April 1994, Prime Minister CILLER introduced an austerity
 package aimed at restoring domestic and international confidence in
 her fragile coalition government. Three months later the IMF endorsed
 the program, paving the way for a $740 million IMF standby loan.
 Although the economy showed signs of improvement following the
 stabilization measures, CILLER has been unable to overcome the
 political obstacles to tough structural reforms necessary for
 sustained, longer-term growth. As a consequence, the economy is
 suffering the worst of both worlds: at the end of 1994, inflation hit
 a record 126% (annual rate), and real GDP dropped an estimated 5% for
 the year as a whole, the worst decline in Turkey's post-war history.
 At the same time, the government missed key 1994 targets stipulated in
 the IMF agreement: the budget deficit is estimated to have overshot
 the government's goal by 47%; the total public sector borrowing
 requirement likely reached 10%-12% of GDP, rather than 8.5% called for
 in the program; and the Turkish lira's value fell 5% to 7% more than
 expected. The unprecedented effort by the Kurdistan Workers' Party
 (PKK) to raise the economic costs of its insurgency against the
 Turkish state is adding to Turkey's economic problems. Attacks against
 tourists have jeopardized tourist revenues, which account for about 3%
 of GDP, while economic activity in southeastern Turkey, where most of
 the violence occurs, has dropped considerably. Turkish officials are
 now negotiating a new letter of intent with the IMF that will
 stipulate more realistic macroeconomic goals for 1995 and allow the
 release of remaining funds of the standby agreement.

@Turkmenistan:Economy

 Overview: Turkmenistan is largely desert country with nomadic cattle
 raising, intensive agriculture in irrigated oases, and huge gas and
 oil resources. Half its irrigated land is planted in cotton making it
 the world's tenth largest producer. It also has the world's fifth
 largest reserves of natural gas and significant oil resources. Until
 the end of 1993, Turkmenistan had experienced less economic disruption
 than other former Soviet states because its economy received a boost
 from higher prices for oil and gas and a sharp increase in hard
 currency earnings. In 1994, Russia's refusal to export Turkmen gas to
 hard currency markets and mounting debts of its major customers in the
 former USSR for gas deliveries contributed to a sharp fall in
 industrial production and caused the budget to shift from a surplus to
 a slight deficit. Furthermore, with an authoritarian ex-Communist
 regime in power and a tribally-based social structure, Turkmenistan
 has taken a cautious approach to economic reform, hoping to use gas
 and cotton sales to sustain its inefficient economy. With the onset of
 economic hard times, even cautious moves toward economic restructuring
 and privatization have slowed down. For 1995, Turkmenistan will face
 continuing constraints on its earnings because of its customers'
 inability to pay for their gas and a low average cotton crop in 1994.
 Turkmenistan is working hard to open new gas export channels through
 Iran and Turkey, but these may take many years to realize.

@Tuvalu:Economy

 Overview: Tuvalu consists of a scattered group of nine coral atolls
 with poor soil. The country has no known mineral resources and few
 exports. Subsistence farming and fishing are the primary economic
 activities. The islands are too small and too remote for development
 of a tourist industry. Government revenues largely come from the sale
 of stamps and coins and worker remittances. Substantial income is
 received annually from an international trust fund established in 1987
 by Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported also by Japan and South
 Korea.
