@Svalbard:Economy

 Overview: Coal mining is the major economic activity on Svalbard. By
 treaty (9 February 1920), the nationals of the treaty powers have
 equal rights to exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian
 regulation. Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have
 mined in the past, the only companies still mining are Norwegian and
 Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are essentially company towns.
 The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs nearly 60% of the
 Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local services,
 and provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some
 trapping of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.

@Swaziland:Economy

 Overview: The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which
 occupies more than 60% of the population and contributes nearly 25% to
 GDP. Manufacturing, which includes a number of agroprocessing
 factories, accounts for another quarter of GDP. Mining has declined in
 importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore deposits were depleted
 by 1978, and health concerns cut world demand for asbestos. Exports of
 sugar and forestry products are the main earners of hard currency.
 Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with Mozambique,
 Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it receives
 90% of its imports and to which it sends about half of its exports.
 Remittances from Swazi workers in South African mines may supplement
 domestically produced income by as much as 20%.

@Sweden:Economy

 Overview: Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World
 War I through World War II, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard
 of living under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive
 welfare benefits. It has a modern distribution system, excellent
 internal and external communications, and a skilled labor force.
 Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an
 economy that is heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned
 firms account for about 90% of industrial output, of which the
 engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. In 1990,
 agriculture accounted for only 1.2% of GDP and 1.9% of the jobs,
 Sweden being about 50% sufficient in most products. In the last few
 years, however, this extraordinarily favorable picture has been
 clouded by inflation, growing unemployment, and a gradual loss of
 competitiveness in international markets. Although Prime Minister
 BILDT's center-right minority coalition had hoped to charge ahead with
 free-market-oriented reforms, a skyrocketing budget deficit - about
 14% of GDP in FY93/94 projections - and record unemployment have
 forestalled many of the plans. Unemployment in 1994 is estimated at
 around 9% with another 5% in job training. Continued heavy foreign
 exchange speculation forced the government to cooperate in late 1992
 with the opposition Social Democrats on two crisis packages - one a
 severe austerity pact and the other a program to spur industrial
 competitiveness - which basically set economic policy through 1997. In
 November 1992, Sweden broke its tie to the EC's ECU, and the krona has
 since depreciated about 25% against the dollar. The boost in export
 competitiveness from the depreciation helped lift Sweden out of its
 3-year recession. To curb the budget deficit and bolster confidence in
 the economy, the new Social Democratic government is proposing cuts in
 welfare benefits, subsidies, defense, and foreign aid. Sweden has
 harmonized its economic policies with those of the EU, which it joined
 at the start of 1995.

@Switzerland:Economy

 Overview: Switzerland's economy - one of the most prosperous and
 stable in the world - is nonetheless undergoing a stressful adjustment
 after both the inflationary boom of the late 1980s and the
 electorate's rejection of membership in the European Economic Area
 (EEA) in 1992. So far the decision to remain outside the European
 single market structure does not appear to have harmed Swiss
 interests. In December 1994, the Swiss began bilateral negotiations
 with the EU aimed at establishing closer ties in areas of mutual
 interest and progressing toward the free circulation of persons,
 goods, capital, and services between the two parties. The Swiss
 emerged from a three-year recession in mid-1993 and posted 1.8% GDP
 growth in 1994. The Swiss central bank's tight monetary policies
 brought inflation down from about 4% in 1992 to just under 1% in 1994.
 Unemployment has fallen slightly from 5.1% in 1993 to 4.7% in 1994.
 Swiss per capita output, living standards, education, and health care
 remain unsurpassed in Europe. The country has few mineral resources,
 but its spectacular natural beauty sustains a substantial tourism
 industry.

@Syria:Economy

 Overview: In 1990-93 Syria's state-dominated Ba'thist economy
 benefited from the Gulf war, increased oil production, good weather,
 and economic deregulation. Economic growth averaged roughly 10%. The
 Gulf war provided Syria an aid windfall of nearly $5 billion dollars
 from Arab, European, and Japanese donors. However, the benefits of the
 1990-93 boom were not evenly distributed and the gap between rich and
 poor is widening. A nationwide financial scandal and increasing
 inflation were accompanied by a decline in GDP growth to 4% in 1994.
 For the long run, Syria's economy is still saddled with a large number
 of poorly performing public sector firms, and industrial productivity
 remains to be improved. Oil production is likely to fall off
 dramatically by the end of the decade. Unemployment will become a
 problem for the government when the more than 60% of the population
 under the age of 20 enter the labor force.

@Taiwan:Economy

 Overview: Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with considerable
 government guidance of investment and foreign trade and partial
 government ownership of some large banks and industrial firms. Real
 growth in GNP has averaged about 9% a year during the past three
 decades. Export growth has been even faster and has provided the
 impetus for industrialization. Inflation and unemployment are
 remarkably low. Agriculture contributes about 4% to GDP, down from 35%
 in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13 among major trading
 countries. Traditional labor-intensive industries are steadily being
 replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive industries.
 Taiwan has become a major investor in China, Thailand, Indonesia, the
 Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The tightening of labor markets
 has led to an influx of foreign workers, both legal and illegal.

TAJIKISTAN

 Note--Tajikistan has experienced three changes of government since it
 gained independence in September 1991. The current president, Emomali
 RAKHMONOV, was elected to the presidency in November 1994, yet has
 been in power since 1992. The country is suffering through its third
 year of a civil war, with no clear end in sight. Underlying the
 conflict are deeply-rooted regional and clan-based animosities that
 pit a government consisting of people primarily from the Kulob
 (Kulyab), Khujand (Leninabad), and Hisor (Hissar) regions against a
 secular and Islamic-led opposition from the Gharm, Gorno-Badakhshan,
 and Qurghonteppa (Kurgan-Tyube) regions. Government and opposition
 representatives have held periodic rounds of UN-mediated peace talks
 and agreed in September 1994 to a cease-fire. Russian-led peacekeeping
 troops are deployed throughout the country, and Russian border guards
 are stationed along the Tajik-Afghan border.
