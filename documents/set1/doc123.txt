@Gabon:Economy

 Overview: Notwithstanding its serious ongoing economic problems, Gabon
 enjoys a per capita income more than twice that of most nations of
 sub-Saharan Africa. Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil
 was discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The oil sector now
 accounts for 50% of GDP. Real growth was feeble in 1992 and Gabon
 continues to face the problem of fluctuating prices for its oil,
 timber, manganese, and uranium exports. Despite an abundance of
 natural wealth, and a manageable rate of population growth, the
 economy is hobbled by poor fiscal management. In 1992, the fiscal
 deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed to settle arrears on
 its bilateral debt, leading to a cancellation of rescheduling
 agreements with official and private creditors. Devaluation of its
 Francophone currency by 50% in January 1994 did not set off an
 expected inflationary spiral but the government must continue to keep
 a tight reign on spending and wage increases.

@The Gambia:Economy

 Overview: The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural
 resources and has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of the
 population is engaged in crop production and livestock raising, which
 contribute 30% to GDP. Small-scale manufacturing activity - processing
 peanuts, fish, and hides - accounts for less than 10% of GDP. A
 sustained structural adjustment program, including a liberalized trade
 policy, had fostered a respectable 4% rate of growth in recent years.
 Reexport trade constitutes one-third of economic activity; however,
 border closures associated with Senegal's monetary crisis in late 1993
 led to a halving of reexport trade, reducing government revenues in
 turn. The 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 has made
 Senegalese goods more competitive and apparently prompted a relaxation
 of Senegalese controls, paving the way for a comeback in reexports.
 But overwhelming these developments were the devastating effects of
 the military's takeover in July 1994. By October, traffic at the Port
 of Banjul had fallen precipitously as importers nervously scaled back
 their activities with the commencement of the anticorruption drive by
 the new regime. Concerned with the growing potential for serious
 unrest after a countercoup attempt was bloodily put down by the
 regime, the United Kingdom and the EU in November issued a travelers
 advisory for The Gambia, which brought a halt to tourism almost
 immediately. The Gambia faces additional problems in 1995 if, as is
 likely, economic sanctions by Western governments remain in effect in
 response to indications that the military regime intends to stay in
 power far longer than expected by the donors.

 Note: Under the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
 Self-Government Arrangements ("the DOP"), Israel agreed to transfer
 certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, and
 subsequently to an elected Palestinian Council, as part of interim
 self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A
 transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho
 has taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement
 on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area. The DOP provides that Israel
 will retain responsibility during the transitional period for external
 security and for internal security and public order of settlements and
 Israelis. Final status is to be determined through direct negotiations
 within five years.

@Gaza Strip:Economy

 Overview: In 1991 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed
 across the border by Israeli industrial, construction, and
 agricultural enterprises, with worker remittances supplementing GDP by
 roughly 50%. Gaza depends upon Israel for nearly 90% of its external
 trade. Aggravating the impact of Israeli military administration,
 unrest in the territory since 1988 (intifadah) has raised unemployment
 and lowered the standard of living of Gazans. The Persian Gulf crisis
 and its aftershocks also have dealt blows to Gaza since August 1990.
 Worker remittances from the Gulf states have dropped, unemployment has
 increased, and exports have fallen. The withdrawal of Israel from the
 Gaza Strip in May 1994 brings a new set of adjustment problems.

GEORGIA

 Note--Georgia has been beset by ethnic and civil strife since
 independence. In late 1991, the country's first elected president,
 Zviad GAMSAKHURDIA was ousted in an armed coup. In October 1993,
 GAMSAKHURDIA, and his supporters sponsored a failed attempt to retake
 power from the current government led by former Soviet Foreign
 Minister Eduard SHEVARDNADZE. The Georgian government has also faced
 armed separatist conflicts in the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions.
 A cease-fire went into effect in South Ossetia in June 1992 and a
 joint Georgian-Ossetian-Russian peacekeeping force has been in place
 since that time. Georgian forces were driven out of the Abkhaz region
 in September 1993 after a yearlong war with Abkhaz separatists. Nearly
 200,000 Georgian refugees have since fled Abkhazia, adding
 substantially to the estimated 100,000 internally displaced persons
 already in Georgia. Russian peacekeepers are deployed along the border
 of Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia.

@Georgia:Economy

 Overview: Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved around Black
 Sea tourism; cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and grapes; mining of
 manganese and copper; and a small industrial sector producing wine,
 metals, machinery, chemicals, and textiles. The country imports the
 bulk of its energy needs, including natural gas and oil products. Its
 only sizable domestic energy resource is hydropower. Since 1990,
 widespread conflicts, e.g., in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and
 Mingreliya, have severely aggravated the economic crisis resulting
 from the disintegration of the Soviet command economy in December
 1991. Throughout 1993 and 1994, much of industry was functioning at
 only 20% of capacity; heavy disruptions in agricultural cultivation
 were reported; and tourism was shut down. The country is precariously
 dependent on US and EU humanitarian grain shipments, as most other
 foods are priced beyond reach of the average citizen. Georgia is also
 suffering from an acute energy crisis, as it is having problems paying
 for even minimal imports. Georgia is pinning its hopes for recovery on
 reestablishing trade ties with Russia and on developing international
 transportation through the key Black Sea ports of P'ot'i and Bat'umi.
 The government began a tenuous program in 1994 aiming to stabilize
 prices and reduce large consumer subsidies.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $6 billion (1994
 estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)

 National product real growth rate: -30% (1994 est.)

@Germany:Economy

 Overview: Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, progress
 towards economic integration between eastern and western Germany is
 clearly visible, yet the eastern region almost certainly will remain
 dependent on subsidies funded by western Germany until well into the
 next century. The staggering $390 billion in western German assistance
 that the eastern states have received since 1990 - 40 times the amount
 in real terms of US Marshall Fund aid sent to West Germany after World
 War II - is just beginning to have an impact on the eastern German
 standard of living, which plummeted after unification. Assistance to
 the east continues to run at roughly $100 billion annually. Although
 the growth rate in the east was much greater than in the west in
 1993-94, eastern GDP per capita nonetheless remains well below
 preunification levels; it will take 10-15 years for the eastern states
 to match western Germany's living standards. The economic recovery in
 the east is led by the construction industries which account for
 one-third of industrial output, with growth increasingly supported by
 the service sectors and light manufacturing industries. Eastern
 Germany's economy is changing from one anchored on manufacturing to a
 more service-oriented economy. Western Germany, with three times the
 per capita output of the eastern states, has an advanced market
 economy and is a world leader in exports. The strong recovery in 1994
 from recession began in the export sector and spread to the investment
 and consumption sectors in response to falling interest rates. Western
 Germany has a highly urbanized and skilled population that enjoys
 excellent living standards, abundant leisure time, and comprehensive
 social welfare benefits. It is relatively poor in natural resources,
 coal being the most important mineral. Western Germany's world-class
 companies manufacture technologically advanced goods. The region's
 economy is mature: services and manufacturing account for the dominant
 share of economic activities, and raw materials and semimanufactured
 goods constitute a large portion of imports.

@Ghana:Economy

 Overview: Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana is relatively
 well off, having twice the per capita output of the poorer countries
 in West Africa. Heavily reliant on international assistance, Ghana has
 made steady progress in liberalizing its economy since 1983. Overall
 growth continued at a rate of approximately 5% in 1994, due largely to
 increased gold, timber, and cocoa production - major sources of
 foreign exchange. The economy, however, continues to revolve around
 subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 45% of GDP and employs 55%
 of the work force, mainly small landholders. Public sector wage
 increases, regional peacekeeping commitments, and the containment of
 internal unrest in the underdeveloped north have placed substantial
 demands on the government's budget and have led to inflationary
 deficit financing and a 27% depreciation of the cedi in 1994.
