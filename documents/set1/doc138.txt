@Panama:Economy

 Overview: Because of its key geographic location, Panama's economy is
 service-based, heavily weighted toward banking, commerce, and tourism.
 Trade and financial ties with the US are especially close. GDP grew at
 3.6% in 1994, a respectable rate, yet below the 7.1% average of the
 early 1990s. Banking and financial services and trade through the
 Colon Free Zone continued to expand rapidly, with the industrial and
 agricultural sectors experiencing little growth. The new
 administration, inaugurated 1 September 1994, has launched an economic
 plan designed to reverse rising unemployment, attract foreign
 investment, cut back the size of government, and modernize the
 economy. The success of the plan in meeting its goals for 1995 and
 beyond depends largely on the success of the administration in
 reforming the labor code and instituting the reforms necessary to join
 the GATT.

@Papua New Guinea:Economy

 Overview: Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources,
 but exploitation has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high
 cost of developing an infrastructure. Agriculture provides a
 subsistence livelihood for 85% of the population. Mining of numerous
 deposits, including copper and gold, accounts for about 60% of export
 earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and development aid under
 World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy. Robust growth in
 1991-92 was led by the mining sector; the opening of a large new gold
 mine helped the advance. At the start of 1995, Port Moresby is looking
 primarily to the exploitation of mineral and petroleum resources to
 drive economic development but new prospecting in Papua New Guinea has
 slumped as other mineral-rich countries have stepped up their
 competition for international investment. Output from current projects
 will probably begin to taper off in 1996, but no new large ventures
 are being developed to succeed them.

@Paraguay:Economy

 Overview: Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25% of
 GDP, employs about 45% of the labor force, and provides the bulk of
 exports, in which soybeans and cotton are the most important. Paraguay
 lacks substantial mineral or petroleum resources but possesses a large
 hydropower potential. In a major step to increase its economic
 activity in the region, Paraguay in March 1991 joined the Southern
 Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes Brazil, Argentina, and
 Uruguay. In 1992, the government, through an unorthodox approach,
 reduced external debt with both commercial and official creditors by
 purchasing a sizable amount of the delinquent commercial debt in the
 secondary market at a substantial discount. The government had paid
 100% of remaining official debt arrears to the US, Germany, France,
 and Spain. All commercial debt arrears have been rescheduled. For the
 long run, the government must press forward with general,
 market-oriented economic reforms. Growth of 3.5% in 1993 was spurred
 by higher-than-expected agricultural output and rising international
 commodity prices. Inflation picked up steam in fourth quarter 1993
 because of rises in public sector salaries and utility rates. GDP
 growth continued in 1994 at 3.5%. Although inflation declined a bit
 over 1993, increases in food prices, and crop and infrastructure
 damage from heavy rains at the end of the year, forced inflation to
 18%, above the government's target of 15%. Paraguay reaffirmed its
 commitment to MERCOSUR on 1 January 1995 by implementing the
 organization's common external tariff.

 note: the 1979 Constitution mandated the creation of regions
 (regiones, singular - region) to function eventually as autonomous
 economic and administrative entities; so far, 12 regions have been
 constituted from 23 of the 24 departments - Amazonas (from Loreto),
 Andres Avelino Caceres (from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin), Arequipa (from
 Arequipa), Chavin (from Ancash), Grau (from Tumbes, Piura), Inca (from
 Cusco, Madre de Dios, Apurimac), La Libertad (from La Libertad), Los

 (from Moquegua, Tacna, Puno), Nor Oriental del Maranon (from
 Lambayeque, Cajamarca, Amazonas), San Martin (from San Martin),
 Ucayali (from Ucayali); formation of another region has been delayed
 by the reluctance of the constitutional province of Callao to merge
 with the department of Lima; because of inadequate funding from the
 central government and organizational and political difficulties, the
 regions have yet to assume major responsibilities; the 1993
 Constitution retains the regions but limits their authority; the 1993
 Constitution also reaffirms the roles of departmental and municipal

@Peru:Economy

 Overview: The Peruvian economy has become increasingly
 market-oriented, with major privatizations completed in 1994 in the
 mining and telecommunications industries. In the 1980s the economy
 suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita output, and
 mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World Bank
 support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An
 austerity program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government
 took office in July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly
 contraction of economic activity, but the slide came to a halt late
 that year, and in 1991 output rose 2.4%. After a burst of inflation as
 the austerity program eliminated government price subsidies, monthly
 price increases eased to the single-digit level and by December 1991
 dropped to the lowest increase since mid-1987. Lima obtained a
 financial rescue package from multilateral lenders in September 1991,
 although it faced $14 billion in arrears on its external debt. By
 working with the IMF and World Bank on new financial conditions and
 arrangements, the government succeeded in ending its arrears by March
 1993. In 1992, GDP had fallen by 2.8%, in part because a
 warmer-than-usual El Nino current resulted in a 30% drop in the fish
 catch, but the economy rebounded as strong foreign investment helped
 push growth to 6% in 1993 and 8.6% in 1994.

@Philippines:Economy

 Overview: Domestic output in this primarily agricultural economy
 failed to grow in 1992 and rose only slightly in 1993. Drought and
 power supply problems hampered production, while inadequate revenues
 prevented government pump priming. Worker remittances helped to
 supplement GDP. A marked increase in capital goods imports,
 particularly power generating equipment, telecommunications equipment,
 and electronic data processors, contributed to 20% annual import
 growth in 1992-94. Provided the government can cope with the
 substantial trade deficit and meet the fiscal targets agreed to with
 the IMF, the Philippines should duplicate the strong growth
 performance of 1994 in 1995-96.
