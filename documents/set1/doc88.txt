@Mauritania, Economy

Overview: 
  A majority of the population still depends on agriculture and
  livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many
  subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts
  in the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore,
  which account for almost 50% of total exports. The decline in world
  demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks in production. The
  nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the
  world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source of
  revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near Nouakchott in
  1986. In recent years, drought and economic mismanagement have
  resulted in a substantial buildup of foreign debt. The government has
  begun the second stage of an economic reform program in consultation
  with the World Bank, the IMF, and major donor countries.

@Mayotte, Economy

Overview: 
  Economic activity is based primarily on the agricultural sector,
  including fishing and livestock raising. Mayotte is not
  self-sufficient and must import a large portion of its food
  requirements, mainly from France. The economy and future development
  of the island are heavily dependent on French financial assistance.
  Mayotte's remote location is an obstacle to the development of
  tourism.

@Mexico, Economy

Overview: 
  Mexico's economy, made up predominantly of private manufacturing and
  services and both large-scale and traditional agriculture, is
  beginning to rebound from the economic difficulties of the 1980s but
  still faces key challenges. During the 1980s, the accumulation of
  large external debts, falling world petroleum prices, rapid population
  growth, and mounting inflation and unemployment plagued the economy.
  In recent years, the government has responded by implementing sweeping
  economic reforms. Strict fiscal and monetary discipline have brought
  inflation under control, reduced the internal debt, and produced
  budgetary surpluses in 1992 and 1993. The tight money policies,
  however, have restricted growth: barely 0.4% in 1993 after a rise of
  2.6% in 1992 and 3.6% in 1991. Another aspect of the reform has been
  the privatization of more than 80% of Mexico's businesses, including
  all of the commercial banks. Seeking out increased trade and
  investment opportunities, the government negotiated the North American
  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada, which
  entered into force on 1 January 1994. Within Latin America, Mexico has
  completed bilateral free trade agreements with Chile and Costa Rica,
  and is continuing negotiations with Colombia and Venezuela for a
  trilateral deal in addition to holding trade discussions with various
  other nations. In January of 1993, Mexico replaced its old peso at the
  rate of 1,000 old to 1 new peso. Despite its hard-won economic
  progress and the prospects of long-term gains under NAFTA, Mexico
  still faces difficult problems, including sluggish growth,
  unemployment, continuing social inequalities, serious pollution, and
  the prospect of increased competition with the opening of trade.

@Micronesia, Federated States of, Economy

Overview: 
  Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and
  fishing. The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting,
  except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry
  exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack of adequate
  facilities hinder development. Financial assistance from the US is the
  primary source of revenue, with the US pledged to spend $1 billion in
  the islands in the l990s. Geographical isolation and a poorly
  developed infrastructure are major impediments to long-term growth.

@Moldova, Economy

Overview: 
  Moldova has pushed ahead boldly on economic reform since gaining its
  independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. It introduced a
  convertible currency - the leu - in late 1993 that has remained stable
  against the dollar, removed price controls on most products,
  eliminated licenses and quotas on most imports and exports, and freed
  interest rates. In 1994, Moldova aims to privatize at least one-third
  of state enterprises, lower inflation to 1% per month, and reduce the
  budget deficit to 3.5% of GDP. Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and
  good farmland but has no major mineral deposits. As a result,
  Moldova's economy is primarily based on agriculture, featuring fruits,
  vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Moldova, however, must import all of
  its supplies of oil, coal, and natural gas, and energy shortages have
  contributed to sharp production declines since the break-up of the
  Soviet Union. Activities by separatist groups in the Dniester region
  have held back economic development in that area. Foreign economic
  assistance has been a tangible plus for Moldova, whereas direct
  foreign investment has been lacking.
National product: 
  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $16.3 billion (1993 estimate from
  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and

  very uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)
