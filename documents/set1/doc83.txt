@Japan, Economy

Overview: 
  Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, mastery of high
  technology, and a comparatively small defense allocation have helped
  Japan advance with extraordinary rapidity to the rank of second most
  powerful economy in the world. Industry, the most important sector of
  the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels.
  Self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of its
  requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of
  the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the
  global catch. Overall economic growth has been spectacular: a 10%
  average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and 1980s. Economic
  growth came to a halt in 1992-93 largely because of contractionary
  domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the
  stock and real estate markets. At the same time, the stronger yen and
  slower global growth are containing export growth. Unemployment and
  inflation remain remarkably low in comparison with the other
  industrialized nations. Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus -
  $120 billion in 1993, up more than 10% from the year earlier - which
  supports extensive investment in foreign assets. The new prime
  minister HATA in early 1994 reiterated previous governments' vows of
  administrative and economic reform, including reduction in the trade
  surplus, but his weak coalition government faces strong resistance
  from traditional interest groups. The crowding of the habitable land
  area and the aging of the population are two major long-run problems.

@Jersey, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy is based largely on financial services, agriculture, and
  tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are
  important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of
  dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export
  earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EU countries. In 1986 the
  finance sector overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP,
  accounting for 40% of the island's output. In recent years the
  government has encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey, with the
  result that an electronics industry has developed alongside the
  traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material and energy
  requirements are imported, as well as a large share of Jersey's food
  needs.

@Jordan, Economy

Overview: 
  Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the
  late 1970s and early 1980s, when its annual real GNP growth averaged
  more than 10%. In the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in
  both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real economic growth to an
  average of roughly 2% per year. Imports - mainly oil, capital goods,
  consumer durables, and food - outstripped exports, with the difference
  covered by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian
  Government began debt-rescheduling negotiations and agreed to
  implement an IMF-supported program designed to gradually reduce the
  budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms. The
  Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, aggravated
  Jordan's already serious economic problems, forcing the government to
  shelve the IMF program, stop most debt payments, and suspend
  rescheduling negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker
  remittances and trade contracted, and refugees flooded the country,
  producing serious balance-of-payments problems, stunting GDP growth,
  and straining government resources. The economy rebounded in 1992,
  largely due to the influx of capital repatriated by workers returning
  from the Gulf, but the recovery has been losing steam since mid-1993.
  The government is implementing the reform program adopted in 1992 and
  continues to secure rescheduling of its heavy foreign debt.

@Kazakhstan, Economy

Overview: 
  Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former Soviet states in
  territory, possesses vast oil, coal, rare metals, and agricultural
  resources. While the economy is gradually making the transition from a
  Soviet command system to a market system, strong elements of state
  control persist including government ownership of most economic assets
  and a continued system of mandatory state procurement for the key
  products such as grain and energy; likewise, agriculture remains
  largely collectivized. On the other hand, new businesses are forming
  rapidly, the economy is opening to foreign investment, and 12% of
  state-owned commercial enterprises have been privatized. In 1993, a
  three-year industrial privatization program was launched; an
  independent currency was successfully introduced; and two large joint
  ventures were established with western oil companies. These
  far-reaching structural transformations have resulted in a cumulative
  decline in national income of more than 30% since 1990. Loose monetary
  policies have kept the inflation rate high, averaging 28% per month
  for 1993 and accelerating at the end with the disruption caused by a
  new currency. Since the introduction of its independent currency in
  November 1993, the government has renewed its commitment to fiscal
  discipline and accelerating economic reform. However, growing economic
  hardship and rising ethnic tensions between Kazakhs and Russians over
  the division of economic assets will likely lead to strong pressure to
  backtrack.

@Kenya, Economy

Overview: 
  Kenya's 3.1% annual population growth rate - one of the highest in the
  world - has led to a decline in per capita output in each of the last
  three years, 1991-93. Undependable weather conditions and a shortage
  of arable land hamper long-term growth in agriculture, the leading
  economic sector. In industry and services, Nairobi's reluctance to
  embrace IMF-supported reforms has held back investment. Ethnic clashes
  and continued suspension of quick disbursing aid by the international
  donors kept growth at only 0.5% in 1993.
