@Bulgaria, Economy

Overview: 
  The Bulgarian economy continued its painful adjustment in 1993 from
  the misdirected development undertaken during four decades of
  Communist rule. Many aspects of a market economy have been put in
  place and have begun to function, but much of the economy, especially
  the industrial sector, has yet to re-establish market links lost with
  the collapse of other centrally planned Eastern European economies.
  The prices of many imported industrial inputs, especially energy
  products, have risen markedly, and falling real wages have not
  sufficed to restore competitiveness. The trade deficit, exacerbated by
  UN trade sanctions against neighboring Serbia, grew in late 1993,
  accelerating the depreciation of the lev. These difficulties in
  adjusting to the challenges of a more open system, together with a
  severe drought, caused nonagricultural output to fall by perhaps 8% in
  1993. The government plans more extensive privatization in 1994 to
  improve the management of state enterprises and to encourage foreign
  investment in ailing state firms. Bulgaria resumed payments on its $10
  billion in commercial debt in 1993 following the negotiation of a 50%
  write-off. An IMF program and second agreement with official creditors
  on Bulgaria's smaller amount of official debt are required to close
  the debt deal.

@Burma, Economy

Overview: 
  Burma has a mixed economy with about 70% private activity, mainly in
  agriculture, light industry, and transport, and with about 30%
  state-controlled activity, mainly in energy, heavy industry, and
  foreign trade. Government policy in the last five years, 1989-93, has
  aimed at revitalizing the economy after four decades of tight central
  planning. Thus, private activity has markedly increased; foreign
  investment has been encouraged, so far with moderate success; and
  efforts continue to increase the efficiency of state enterprises.
  Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly understated
  because of the volume of black market trade. A major ongoing problem
  is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal stability. Inflation has
  been running at 25% to 30% annually. Good weather helped boost GDP by
  perhaps 5% in 1993. Although Burma remains a poor Asian country, its
  rich resources furnish the potential for substantial long-term
  increases in income, exports, and living standards.

@Burundi, Economy

Overview: 
  A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of economic
  development, Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few
  basic industries. Its economic health depends on the coffee crop,
  which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange earnings. The ability to
  pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of
  the climate and the international coffee market. As part of its
  economic reform agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World
  Bank support, Burundi is trying to diversify its agricultural exports
  and attract foreign investment in industry. Several state-owned coffee
  companies were privatized via public auction in September 1991.

@Cambodia, Economy

Overview: 
  The Cambodian economy - virtually destroyed by decades of war - is
  slowly recovering. Government leaders are moving toward restoring
  fiscal and monetary discipline and have established good working
  relations with international financial institutions. Despite such
  positive developments, the reconstruction effort faces many tough
  challenges. Rural Cambodia, where 90% of almost ten million Khmer
  live, remains mired in poverty. The almost total lack of basic
  infrastructure in the countryside will hinder development and will
  contribute to a growing imbalance in growth between urban and rural
  areas over the near term. Moreover, the new government's lack of
  experience in administering economic and technical assistance
  programs, and rampant corruption among officials, will slow the growth
  of critical public sector investment. Inflation for 1993 as a whole
  was 60%, less than a quarter of the 1992 rate, and was declining
  during the year. The government hoped the rate would fall to 10% in
  early 1994.

@Cameroon, Economy

Overview: 
  Because of its offshore oil resources and favorable agricultural
  conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed, most diversified
  primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces
  many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries,
  such as political instability, a top-heavy civil service, and a
  generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. The development
  of the oil sector led rapid economic growth between 1970 and 1985.
  Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986, precipitated by steep declines
  in the prices of major exports: coffee, cocoa, and petroleum. Export
  earnings were cut by almost one-third, and inefficiencies in fiscal
  management were exposed. In 1990-93, with support from the IMF and
  World Bank, the government began to introduce reforms designed to spur
  business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, and
  recapitalize the nation's banks. Political instability following
  suspect elections in 1992 brought IMF/WB structural adjustment to a
  halt. Although the 50% devaluation of the currency in January 1994
  improves the potential for export growth, mismanagement remains and is
  the main barrier to economic improvement.
