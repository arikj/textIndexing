@Uzbekistan:Economy

 Overview: Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country of which 10%
 consists of intensely cultivated, irrigated river valleys. It is one
 of the poorest states of the former USSR with 60% of its population
 living in overpopulated rural communities. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan is
 the world's third largest cotton exporter, a major producer of gold
 and natural gas, and a regionally significant producer of chemicals
 and machinery. Since independence, the government has sought to prop
 up the Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight controls
 on prices and production. Such policies have buffered the economy from
 the sharp declines in output and high inflation experienced by many
 other former Soviet republics. They had become increasingly
 unsustainable, however, as inflation moves along at 14% per month and
 as Russia has forced the Uzbek government to introduce its own
 currency. Faced with mounting economic problems, the government has
 begun to move on a reform agenda and cooperate with international
 financial institutions, announced an acceleration of privatization,
 and stepped up efforts to attract foreign investors. Nevertheless, the
 regime is likely to find it difficult to sustain its drive for
 economic reform.

@Venezuela:Economy

 Overview: Despite efforts to broaden the base of the economy,
 petroleum continues to play a dominant role. In 1994, as GDP declined
 3.3%, the oil sector - which accounts for 24% of the total - enjoyed a
 6% expansion, provided 45% of the budget revenues, and generated 70%
 of the export earnings. President CALDERA, who assumed office in
 February 1994, has used an interventionist, reactive approach to
 managing the economy, instituting price and foreign exchange controls
 in mid-year to slow inflation and stop the loss of foreign exchange
 reserves. The government claims it will remove these controls once
 inflationary pressures abate, but the $8 billion bailout of the
 banking sector in 1994 has made it difficult for the government to
 make good on its promise. Economic controls, coupled with political
 uncertainty driven by recurrent coup rumors, continue to deter foreign
 and domestic investment; private forecasters see the recession
 persisting for a third year in 1995.

@Vietnam:Economy

 Overview: Vietnam has made significant progress in recent years moving
 away from the planned economic model toward a more effective
 market-based economic system. Most prices are now fully decontrolled,
 and the Vietnamese currency has been effectively devalued and floated
 at world market rates. In addition, the scope for private sector
 activity has been expanded, primarily through decollectivization of
 the agricultural sector and introduction of laws giving legal
 recognition to private business. Nearly three-quarters of export
 earnings are generated by only two commodities, rice and crude oil.
 Led by industry and construction, the economy did well in 1993 and
 1994 with output rising 7% and 9% respectively. However, the
 industrial sector remains burdened by noncompetitive state-owned
 enterprises the government is unwilling or unable to privatize.
 Unemployment looms as a serious problem with roughly 20% of the work
 force without jobs and with population growth swelling the ranks of
 the labor force yearly.
