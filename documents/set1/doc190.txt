Economy

Economy - overview: Because of its key geographic location, Panama's
economy is service-based, heavily weighted toward banking, commerce,
and tourism. Panama's former protectionist policies have taken their
toll, and the economy has been sluggish the last two years, with GDP
growth at 1.9% in 1995 and 1.5% in 1996. Although tourism and the
Panama Canal posted growth in 1996, most sectors remained stagnant,
and some, like the Colon Free Zone, banana and shrimp exports, and
construction, were down from 1995. Although the PEREZ BALLADARES
administration has advanced an economic reform program designed to
liberalize the trade regime, attract foreign investment, privatize
state-owned enterprises, institute fiscal reform, and encourage
job-creation through labor code reform, the positive effects of this
program have not yet been felt at the macroeconomic level. In 1996,
the government concluded a Brady-type plan to restructure the
country's commercial debt - one of the highest in the world in per
capita terms - allowing it to reenter international financial markets.
Panama also completed all requirements to join the World Trade
Organization (WTrO) and is awaiting legislative ratification to become
a full member.

Economy

Economy - overview: Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural
resources, but exploitation has been hampered by the rugged terrain
and the high cost of developing an infrastructure. Agriculture
provides a subsistence livelihood for the bulk of the population.
Mineral deposits, including oil, copper, and gold, account for 72% of
export earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and development aid
under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy. In 1995,
Port Moresby reached agreement with the IMF and World Bank on a
structural adjustment program, of which the first phase was
successfully completed in 1996. A second phase structural adjustment
loan will be negotiated in 1997. The structural adjustment program
includes liberalization of trade and investment policies, sustainable
development of the forestry sector, improvement of government planning
capacity and better delivery of public services. New gold and oil
projects are under development and planned to begin production in 1997
and 1998 respectively.

Economy

Economy - overview: Paraguay has a market economy marked by a large
informal sector. The informal sector features both reexport of
imported consumer goods (electronics, whiskeys, perfumes, cigarettes,
and office equipment) to neighboring countries as well as by the
activities of thousands of microenterprises and urban street vendors.
The formal sector is largely oriented toward services, but a large
percentage of the population derive their living from agricultural
activity, often on a subsistence basis. The formal economy has grown
an average of 3% to 4% over the past five years. However, population
has increased at 3% a year over the same period, leaving per capita
income nearly stagnant. The WASMOSY government has continued to pursue
its economic reform agenda - with mixed success - in close
coordination with its partners in Mercosur (Southern Cone Common
Market). Paraguay's ongoing integration into Mercosur offers potential
for investment and growth. Although GDP grew by only about 1.5% in
1996, it is expected to grow at a higher rate in 1997.

note: the 1979 constitution mandated the creation of regions
(regiones, singular - region) to function eventually as autonomous
economic and administrative entities; so far, 12 regions have been
constituted from 23 of the 24 departments - Amazonas (from Loreto),
Andres Avelino Caceres (from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin), Arequipa (from
Arequipa), Chavin (from Ancash), Grau (from Tumbes, Piura), Inca (from
Cusco, Madre de Dios, Apurimac), La Libertad (from La Libertad), Los

(from Moquegua, Tacna, Puno), Nor Oriental del Maranon (from
Lambayeque, Cajamarca, Amazonas), San Martin (from San Martin),
Ucayali (from Ucayali); formation of another region has been delayed
by the reluctance of the constitutional province of Callao to merge
with the department of Lima; because of inadequate funding from the
central government and organizational and political difficulties, the
regions have yet to assume major responsibilities; the 1993
constitution retains the regions but limits their authority; the 1993
constitution also reaffirms the roles of departmental and municipal

Economy

Economy - overview: The Peruvian economy has become increasingly
market-oriented, with major privatizations completed since 1990 in the
mining, electricity, and telecommunications industries. In the 1980s,
the economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita output,
and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World Bank
support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An
austerity program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government
took office in July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly
contraction of economic activity, but the slide came to a halt late
that year, and in 1991 output rose 2.4%. After a burst of inflation as
the austerity program eliminated government price subsidies, monthly
price increases eased to the single-digit level and by December 1991
dropped to the lowest increase since mid-1987. Lima obtained a
financial rescue package from multilateral lenders in September 1991,
although it faced $14 billion in arrears on its external debt. By
working with the IMF and World Bank on new financial conditions and
arrangements, the government succeeded in ending its arrears by March
1993. In 1992, GDP fell by 2.8%, in part because a warmer-than-usual
El Nino current resulted in a 30% drop in the fish catch, but the
economy rebounded as strong foreign investment helped push growth to
7% in 1993, about 13% in 1994, and 6.8% in 1995. Growth slowed to
about 2.8% in 1996 as the government adopted tight fiscal and monetary
policy to reduce the current account deficit and meet its IMF targets.
Capital inflows surged to record levels in early 1997 despite the MRTA
hostage crisis.

revenues, and moving toward further deregulation and privatization of
the economy.
