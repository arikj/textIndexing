@United States, Economy

Overview: 
  The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologically advanced
  economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $24,700, the largest
  among major industrial nations. The economy is market oriented with
  most decisions made by private individuals and business firms and with
  government purchases of goods and services made predominantly in the
  marketplace. In 1989 the economy enjoyed its seventh successive year
  of substantial growth, the longest in peacetime history. The expansion
  featured moderation in wage and consumer price increases and a steady
  reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of the labor force. In 1990,
  however, growth slowed to 1% because of a combination of factors, such
  as the worldwide increase in interest rates, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
  in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and a general decline
  in business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output fell by 1%,
  unemployment grew, and signs of recovery proved premature. Growth
  picked up to 2.6% in 1992 and to 3.0% in 1993. Unemployment, however,
  declined only gradually, the increase in GDP being mainly attributable
  to gains in output per worker. Ongoing economic problems for the
  remainder of the 1990s include inadequate investment in economic
  infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs, and sizable budget and
  trade deficits.

@Uruguay, Economy

Overview: 
  Uruguay is a small economy with favorable climate, good soils, and
  solid hydropower potential. Economic development has been held back by
  excessive government regulation of economic detail and 50% to 130%
  inflation. After several years of sluggish growth, real GDP jumped by
  about 7.5% in 1992. The rise is attributable mainly to an increase in
  Argentine demand for Uruguayan exports, particularly agricultural
  products and electricity. In a major step toward greater regional
  economic cooperation, Uruguay in 1991 had joined Brazil, Argentina,
  and Paraguay in forming the Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur). A
  referendum in December 1992 overturned key portions of landmark
  privatization legislation, dealing a serious blow to President
  LACALLE's broad economic reform plan. Hampered by a slowdown in the
  agricultural sector, the economy grew at only 2% in 1993 compared with
  7.5% in 1992. Although inflation declined for the second consecutive
  year, a surge in the money supply, rising food prices, a record trade
  deficit, and an increase in the government deficit toward the end of
  the year foreshadowed troubles ahead in 1994.

note: 
  on 1 March 1993 the former New Peso (N$Ur) was replaced as Uruguay's
  unit of currency by the Peso which is equal to 1,000 of the New Pesos;

@Uzbekistan, Economy

Overview: 
  Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country of which 20% is intensely
  cultivated, irrigated river valleys. It is one of the poorest states
  of the former USSR with 60% of its population living in overpopulated
  rural communities. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan is the world's third
  largest cotton exporter, a major producer of gold and natural gas, and
  a regionally significant producer of chemicals and machinery. Since
  independence, the government has sought to prop up the Soviet-style
  command economy with subsidies and tight controls on prices and
  production. Such policies have buffered the economy from the sharp
  declines in output and high inflation experienced by many other former
  Soviet republics. By late 1993, however, they had become increasingly
  unsustainable as inflation soared and Russia forced the Uzbek
  Government to introduce its own currency. Faced with mounting economic
  problems, the government has increased its cooperation with
  international financial institutions, announced an acceleration of
  privatization, and stepped up efforts to attract foreign investors.
  Nevertheless, the regime is likely to resist full-fledged market
  reforms.
National product: 
  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $53.7 billion (1993 estimate from
  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and

Overview: 
  Petroleum is the backbone of the economy, accounting for 23% of GDP,
  61% of central government ordinary revenues, and 77% of export
  earnings in 1993. Former President PEREZ introduced an economic
  readjustment program when he assumed office in February 1989. Lower
  tariffs and the removal of price controls, a free market exchange
  rate, and market-linked interest rates threw the economy into
  confusion, causing an 8% decline in GDP in 1989. The economy recovered
  part way in 1990 and grew by 9.7% in 1991 and 6.8% in 1992; economic
  activity fell by 1% in 1993, primarily because of business concerns
  over political instability.

@Vietnam, Economy

Overview: 
  Vietnam has made significant progress in recent years moving away from
  the planned economic model toward a more effective market-based
  economic system. Most prices are now fully decontrolled, and the
  Vietnamese currency has been effectively devalued and floated at world
  market rates. In addition, the scope for private sector activity has
  been expanded, primarily through decollectivization of the
  agricultural sector and introduction of laws giving legal recognition
  to private business. Nearly three-quarters of export earnings are
  generated by only two commodities, rice and crude oil. Led by industry
  and construction, the economy did well in 1993 with output rising
  perhaps 7%. However, the industrial sector remains burdened by
  uncompetitive state-owned enterprises the government is unwilling or
  unable to privatize. Unemployment looms as a serious problem with
  roughly 25% of the workforce without jobs and with population growth
  swelling the ranks of the unemployed yearly.
