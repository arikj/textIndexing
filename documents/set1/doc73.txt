@Cook Islands, Economy

Overview: 
  Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export earners are
  fruit, copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are limited to a
  fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories. Economic
  development is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign
  markets and a lack of natural resources and good transportation links.
  A large trade deficit is annually made up for by remittances from
  emigrants and from foreign aid, largely from New Zealand. Current
  economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential
  and expanding the fishing industry.

@Cote d'Ivoire, Economy

Overview: 
  Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers and exporters of
  coffee, cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently, the economy is
  highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee
  and cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the
  government to diversify, the economy is still largely dependent on
  agriculture and related industries. The agricultural sector accounts
  for over one-third of GDP and about 80% of export earnings and employs
  about 85% of the labor force. A collapse of world cocoa and coffee
  prices in 1986 threw the economy into a recession, from which the
  country has yet to fully recover. Continuing weak prices for commodity
  exports, a bloated public-sector wage bill, and a large foreign debt
  will continue to constrain economic development, this despite the 50%
  currency devaluation in January 1994 designed to restore international
  price competitiveness. A large, non-competitive import-substitution
  sector continues to thrive under steep tariff and import quota
  barriers.

@Croatia, Economy

Overview: 
  Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic of Croatia, after
  Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized area, with a per
  capita output roughly comparable to that of Portugal and perhaps
  one-third above the Yugoslav average. At present, Croatian Serb
  Nationalists control approximately one-third of the Croatian
  territory, and one of the overriding determinants of Croatia's
  long-term political and economic prospects will be the resolution of
  this territorial dispute. Croatia faces monumental economic problems
  stemming from: the legacy of longtime Communist mismanagement of the
  economy; large foreign debt; damage during the fighting to bridges,
  factories, power lines, buildings, and houses; the large refugee
  population, both Croatian and Bosnian; and the disruption of economic
  ties to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav republics, as well as
  within its own territory. At the minimum, extensive Western aid and
  investment, especially in the tourist and oil industries, would seem
  necessary to salvage a desperate economic situation. However, peace
  and political stability must come first; only then will recent
  government moves toward a "market-friendly" economy reverse the sharp
  drop in output. As of May 1994, fighting continues among Croats,
  Serbs, and Muslims, and national boundaries and final political
  arrangements are still in doubt.

@Cuba, Economy

Overview: 
  Cuba's heavily statist economy remains in a severe depression as a
  result of the loss of massive amounts of economic aid from the former
  Soviet Bloc. In 1989-93, GDP declined by about 40% and import
  capability fell by about 80%. Reduced imports of fuel, spare parts,
  and chemicals combined with rainy weather to cut the production of
  sugar - the country's top export - from 7 million tons in 1992 to 4.3
  million tons in 1993, causing a loss of more than $400 million in
  export revenue. The government implemented several measures designed
  to stem the economic decline, e.g., legalizing the use of foreign
  currency by Cuban citizens in August 1993 in an attempt to increase
  remittances of foreign exchange from abroad. Authorities in September
  1993 began permitting self-employment in over 100 mostly service
  occupations. Also in September the government broke up many state
  farms into smaller, more autonomous cooperative units in an attempt to
  increase worker incentives and boost depressed food production levels.
  Fuel shortages persisted throughout 1993; draft animals and bicycles
  continued to replace motor-driven vehicles, and the use of electricity
  by households and factories was cut from already low levels. With the
  help of foreign investment, tourism has been one bright spot in the
  economy, with arrivals and earnings reaching record highs in 1993.
  Government officials have expressed guarded optimism for 1994, as the
  country struggles to achieve sustainable economic growth at a
  much-reduced standard of living.
