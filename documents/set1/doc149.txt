@West Bank:Government

 Note: Under the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
 Self-Government Arragements ("the DOP"), Israel agreed to transfer
 certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, and
 subsequently to an elected Palestinian Council, as part of interim
 self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A
 transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho
 has taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement
 on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area. A transfer of powers and
 responsibilities in certain spheres for the rest of the West Bank has
 taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 29 August 1994 Agreement on
 Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities. The DOP provides
 that Israel will retain responsibility during the transitional period
 for external security and for internal security and public order of
 settlements and Israelis. Final status is to be determined through
 direct negotiations within five years.

@West Bank:Economy

 Overview: Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by
 Israeli military administration and the effects of the Palestinian
 uprising (intifadah). Industries using advanced technology or
 requiring sizable investment have been discouraged by a lack of local
 capital and restrictive Israeli policies. Capital investment consists
 largely of residential housing, not productive assets that would
 enable local Palestinian firms to compete with Israeli industry. GDP
 has been substantially supplemented by remittances of workers employed
 in Israel and Persian Gulf states. Such transfers from the Gulf
 dropped after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake of the
 Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West Bank,
 increasing unemployment, and export revenues have dropped because of
 the decline of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. Israeli measures
 to curtail the intifadah also have added to unemployment and lowered
 living standards. The area's economic situation has worsened since
 Israel's partial closure of the territories in 1993.

@Western Samoa:Economy

 Overview: Agriculture employs more than half of the labor force,
 contributes 50% to GDP, and furnishes 90% of exports. The bulk of
 export earnings comes from the sale of coconut oil and copra. The
 economy depends on emigrant remittances and foreign aid to support a
 level of imports much greater than export earnings. Tourism has become
 the most important growth industry. The economy continued to falter in
 1994, as remittances and tourist earnings remained low. Production of
 taro, the primary food export crop, has dropped 97% since a fungal
 disease struck the crop in 1993. The rapid growth in 1994 of the giant
 African snail population in Western Samoa is also threatening the
 country's basic food crops, such as bananas and coconuts.

@World:Economy

 Overview: Led by recovery in Western Europe and strong performances by
 the US, Canada, and key Third World countries, real global output -
 gross world product (GWP) - rose 3% in 1994 compared with 2% in 1993.
 Results varied widely among regions and countries. Average growth of
 3% in the GDP of industrialized countries (60% of GWP in 1994) and
 average growth of 6% in the GDP of less developed countries (34% of
 GWP) were partly offset by a further 11% drop in the GDP of the former
 USSR/Eastern Europe area (now only 6% of GWP). With the notable
 exception of Japan at 2.9%, unemployment was typically 5%-12% in the
 industrial world. The US accounted for 22% of GWP in 1994; Western
 Europe accounted for another 22%; and Japan accounted for 8%. These
 are the three "economic superpowers" which are presumably destined to
 compete for mastery in international markets on into the 21st century.
 As for the less developed countries, China, India, and the Four
 Dragons - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore - once again
 posted records of 5% growth or better; however, many other countries,
 especially in Africa, continued to suffer from drought, rapid
 population growth, inflation, and civil strife. Central Europe made
 considerable progress in moving toward "market-friendly" economies,
 whereas the 15 ex-Soviet countries (with the notable exceptions of the
 three Baltic states) typically experienced further declines in output,
 sometimes as high as 30%. Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock
 economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over
 international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.
 Internally, the central government in a number of cases is losing
 control over resources as separatist regional movements - typically
 based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of
 the former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, and in India. In
 Western Europe, governments face the difficult political problem of
 channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase
 investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The addition
 of nearly 100 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe
 is exacerbating the problems of pollution, desertification,
 underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of their own internal
 problems, the industrialized countries have inadequate resources to
 deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world, which, at least
 from the economic point of view, are becoming further marginalized.
 (For the specific economic problems of each country, see the
 individual country entries in this volume.)

 National product: GWP (gross world product) - purchasing power parity
 - $30.7 trillion (1994 est.)

 National product real growth rate: 3.2% (1994 est.)

 National product per capita: $5,400 (1994 est.)

 Inflation rate (consumer prices):
 all countries: 25%
 developed countries: 5%
 developing countries: 50% (1994 est.)
 note: national inflation rates vary widely in individual cases, from
 stable prices to hyperinflation

 Unemployment rate: 30% combined unemployment and underemployment in
 many non-industrialized countries; developed countries typically
 5%-12% unemployment

 Exports: $4 trillion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)
 commodities: the whole range of industrial and agricultural goods and
 services

 Imports: $4.1 trillion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)
 commodities: the whole range of industrial and agricultural goods and
 services

 External debt: $1 trillion for less developed countries (1993 est.)

 Industrial production: growth rate 5% (1994 est.)

 Electricity:
 capacity: 2,773,000,000 kW
 production: 11.601 trillion kWh
 consumption per capita: 1,937 kWh (1993)

 Industries: industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of
 technology, especially in computers, robotics, telecommunications, and
 medicines and medical equipment; most of these advances take place in
 OECD nations; only a small portion of non-OECD countries have
 succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these technological forces, and the
 technological gap between the industrial nations and the
 less-developed countries continues to widen; the rapid development of
 new industrial (and agricultural) technology is complicating already
 grim environmental problems

 Agriculture: the production of major food crops has increased
 substantially in the last 20 years; the annual production of cereals,
 for instance, has risen by 50%, from about 1.2 billion metric tons to
 about 1.8 billion metric tons; production increases have resulted
 mainly from increased yields rather than increases in planted areas;
 while global production is sufficient for aggregate demand, about
 one-fifth of the world's population remains malnourished, primarily
 because local production cannot adequately provide for large and
 rapidly growing populations, which are too poor to pay for food
 imports; conditions are especially bad in Africa where drought in
 recent years has intensified the consequences of overpopulation

@Yemen:Economy

 Overview: Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of
 a united Yemen, the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port
 facilities, is the economic and commercial capital. Future economic
 development depends heavily on Western-assisted development of the
 country's moderate oil resources. Former South Yemen's willingness to
 merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet economic
 support. The low level of domestic industry and agriculture has made
 northern Yemen dependent on imports for practically all of its
 essential needs. Once self-sufficient in food production, northern
 Yemen has become a major importer. Land once used for export crops -
 cotton, fruit, and vegetables - has been turned over to growing a
 shrub called qat, whose leaves are chewed for their stimulant effect
 by Yemenis and which has no significant export market. Economic growth
 in former South Yemen has been constrained by a lack of incentives,
 partly stemming from centralized control over production decisions,
 investment allocation, and import choices. Yemen's large trade
 deficits have been compensated for by remittances from Yemenis working
 abroad and by foreign aid. Since the Gulf crisis, remittances have
 dropped substantially. Growth in 1994-95 is constrained by low oil
 prices, rapid inflation, and political deadlock that are causing a
 lack of economic cooperation and leadership. However, a peace
 agreement with Saudi Arabia in February 1995 and the expectation of a
 rise in oil prices brighten Yemen's economic prospects.

@Zaire:Economy

 Overview: Zaire's economy has continued to disintegrate although Prime
 Minister KENGO has had some success in slowing the rate of economic
 decline. While meaningful economic figures are difficult to come by,
 Zaire's hyperinflation, chronic large government deficits, and
 plunging mineral production have made the country one of the world's
 poorest. Most formal transactions are conducted in hard currency as
 indigenous bank notes have lost almost all value, and a barter economy
 now flourishes in all but the largest cities. Most individuals and
 families hang on grimly through subsistence farming and petty trade.
 The government has not been able to meet its financial obligations to
 the International Monetary Fund or put in place the financial measures
 advocated by the IMF. Although short-term prospects for improvement
 are dim, improved political stability would boost Zaire's long-term
 potential to effectively exploit its vast wealth of mineral and
 agricultural resources.

@Zambia:Economy

 Overview: Prior to 1993 the economy had been in decline for more than
 a decade with falling imports and growing foreign debt. Economic
 difficulties stemmed largely from a chronically depressed level of
 copper production and weak copper prices, generally ineffective
 economic policies, and high inflation. An annual population growth of
 3% brought a decline in per capita GDP of 50% over the decade.
 However, economic reforms enacted since 1992 have helped reduce
 inflation, have begun to strengthen the social safety net, and have
 been accompanied by GDP growth at an estimated 6.8% in 1993 and 4% in
 1994. The huge external debt remains a key problem.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $7.9 billion (1994
 est.)

 National product real growth rate: 4% (1994 est.)

 National product per capita: $860 (1994 est.)

 Inflation rate (consumer prices): 89% (1994 est.)

 Unemployment rate: NA%

 Budget:
 revenues: $665 million
 expenditures: $767 million, including capital expenditures of $300
 million (1991 est.)

 Exports: $1.01 billion (f.o.b., 1993 est.)
 commodities: copper, zinc, cobalt, lead, tobacco
 partners: EC countries, Japan, South Africa, US, India

 Imports: $1.13 billion (c.i.f., 1993 est.)
 commodities: machinery, transportation equipment, foodstuffs, fuels,
 manufactures
 partners: EC countries, Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, US

 External debt: $7.3 billion (1993)
