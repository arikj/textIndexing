@Botswana:Economy

 Overview: The economy has historically been based on cattle raising
 and crops. Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80%
 of the population but supplies only about 50% of food needs and
 accounts for only 5% of GDP. Subsistence farming and cattle raising
 predominate. The driving force behind the rapid economic growth of the
 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry. This sector, mostly on
 the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating 25% of GDP in 1980
 to 39% in 1994. No other sector has experienced such growth,
 especially not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and
 poor soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%. Hampered
 by a still sluggish diamond market in 1994, GDP grew by only 1%.

@Brazil:Economy

 Overview: The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing
 sectors, entered the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway
 inflation, an unserviceable foreign debt of $122 billion, and a lack
 of policy direction. In addition, the economy remained highly
 regulated, inward-looking, and protected by substantial trade and
 investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and mining
 facilities is divided among private interests - including several
 multinationals - and the government. Most large agricultural holdings
 are private, with the government channeling financing to this sector.
 Conflicts between large landholders and landless peasants have
 produced intermittent violence. The COLLOR government, which assumed
 office in March 1990, launched an ambitious reform program that sought
 to modernize and reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices,
 deregulating the economy, and opening it to increased foreign
 competition. Itamar FRANCO, who assumed the presidency following
 President COLLOR's resignation in December 1992, was out of step with
 COLLOR's reform agenda; initiatives to redress fiscal problems,
 privatize state enterprises, and liberalize trade and investment
 policies lost momentum. Galloping inflation - by June 1994 the monthly
 rate had risen to nearly 50% - had undermined economic stability. In
 response, the then finance minister, Fernando Henrique CARDOSO,
 launched the third phase of his stabilization plan, known as Plano
 Real, that called for a new currency, the real, which was introduced
 on 1 July 1994. Inflation subsequently dropped to under 3% per month
 through the end of 1994. The newly elected President CARDOSO has
 called for the implementation of sweeping market-oriented reform,
 including public sector and fiscal reform, privatization,
 deregulation, and elimination of barriers to increased foreign
 investment. Brazil's natural resources remain a major, long-term
 economic strength.

@British Virgin Islands:Economy

 Overview: The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean
 area, is highly dependent on the tourist industry, which generates
 about 21% of the national income. In 1985 the government offered
 offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the
 islands, and, in consequence, incorporation fees generated about $2
 million in 1987. The economy slowed in 1991 because of the poor
 performances of the tourist sector and tight commercial bank credit.
 Livestock raising is the most significant agricultural activity. The
 islands' crops, limited by poor soils, are unable to meet food
 requirements.

@Bulgaria:Economy

 Overview: The Bulgarian economy continued its painful adjustment in
 1994 from the misdirected development undertaken during four decades
 of Communist rule. Many aspects of a market economy have been put in
 place and have begun to function, but much of the economy, especially
 the industrial sector, has yet to re-establish market links lost with
 the collapse of the other centrally planned Soviet Bloc economies. The
 prices of many imported industrial inputs, especially energy products,
 have risen markedly, and falling real wages have not sufficed to
 restore competitiveness. The government plans more extensive
 privatization in 1995 to improve the management of enterprises and to
 encourage foreign investment. Bulgaria resumed payments on its $10
 billion in commercial debt in 1993 following the negotiation of a 50%
 write-off.
