@Germany, Economy

Overview: 
  With the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, prospects
  seemed bright for a fairly rapid incorporation of East Germany into
  the highly successful West German economy. The Federal Republic,
  however, continues to experience difficulties in integrating and
  modernizing eastern Germany, and the tremendous costs of unification
  pushed western Germany into its deepest recession since World War II.
  The western German economy shrank by 1.9% in 1993 as the Bundesbank
  maintained high interest rates to offset the inflationary effects of
  large government deficits and high wage settlements. Eastern Germany
  grew by 7.1% in 1993 but this was from a shrunken base. Despite
  government transfers to the east amounting to nearly $110 billion
  annually, a self-sustaining economy in the region is still some years
  away. The bright spots are eastern Germany's construction,
  transportation, telecommunications, and service sectors, which have
  experienced strong growth. Western Germany has an advanced market
  economy and is a world leader in exports. It has a highly urbanized
  and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards,
  abundant leisure time, and comprehensive social welfare benefits.
  Western Germany is relatively poor in natural resources, coal being
  the most important mineral. Western Germany's world-class companies
  manufacture technologically advanced goods. The region's economy is
  mature: services and manufacturing account for the dominant share of
  economic activity, and raw materials and semimanufactured goods
  constitute a large portion of imports. In recent years, manufacturing
  has accounted for about 31% of GDP, with other sectors contributing
  lesser amounts. Gross fixed investment in 1993 accounted for about
  20.5% of GDP. GDP in the western region is now $19,400 per capita, or
  78% of US per capita GDP. Eastern Germany's economy appears to be
  changing from one anchored on manufacturing into a more
  service-oriented economy. The German government, however, is intent on
  maintaining a manufacturing base in the east and is considering a
  policy for subsidizing industrial cores in the region. Eastern
  Germany's share of all-German GDP is only 8% and eastern productivity
  is just 30% that of the west even though eastern wages are at roughly
  70% of western levels. The privatization agency for eastern Germany,
  Treuhand, has privatized more than 90% of the 13,000 firms under its
  control and will likely wind down operations in 1994. Private
  investment in the region continues to be lackluster, resulting
  primarily from the deepening recession in western Germany and
  excessively high eastern wages. Eastern Germany has one of the world's
  largest reserves of low-grade lignite coal but little else in the way
  of mineral resources. The quality of statistics from eastern Germany
  is improving, yet many gaps remain; the federal government began
  producing all-German data for select economic statistics at the start
  of 1992. The most challenging economic problem is promoting eastern
  Germany's economic reconstruction - specifically, finding the right
  mix of fiscal, monetary, regulatory, and tax policies that will spur
  investment in eastern Germany - without destabilizing western
  Germany's economy or damaging relations with West European partners.
  The government hopes a "solidarity pact" among labor unions, business,
  state governments, and the SPD opposition will provide the right mix
  of wage restraints, investment incentives, and spending cuts to
  stimulate eastern recovery. Finally, the homogeneity of the German
  economic culture has been changed by the admission of large numbers of
  immigrants.

@Ghana, Economy

Overview: 
  Supported by substantial international assistance, Ghana has been
  implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983,
  including moves toward privatization and relaxation of government
  controls. The agriculture sector consists largely of small traditional
  farm holdings, rain-fed for the most part. Heavily dependent on cocoa,
  gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not spread
  substantially to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending
  peacekeeping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a
  democratic government have boosted government expenditures and
  undercut structural adjustment reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange
  in 1990 and plans to float 5% of its stake in Ashanti Goldfields
  Corporation, which would make the exchange the largest in sub-Saharan
  Africa outside of South Africa.

@Gibraltar, Economy

Overview: 
  The British military presence has been severely reduced and now only
  contributes about 11% to the local economy. The financial sector
  accounts for 15% of GDP; tourism and shipping services fees also
  generate income. Because more than 70% of the economy is in the public
  sector, changes in government spending have a major impact on the
  level of employment. Construction workers are particularly affected
  when government expenditures are cut.

@Greece, Economy

Overview: 
  Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the basic entrepreneurial
  system overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist system that enlarged the
  public sector from 55% of GDP in 1981 to about 70% in 1989. Since
  then, the public sector has been reduced to about 60% of GDP. Tourism
  continues as a major source of foreign exchange, and agriculture is
  self-sufficient except for meat, dairy products, and animal
  feedstuffs. Over the last decade, real GDP growth has averaged 1.6% a
  year, compared with the European Union average of 2.2%. Inflation is
  four times the EU average, and the national debt has reached 140% of
  GDP, the highest in the EU. Prime Minister PAPANDREOU will probably
  only make limited progress correcting the economy's problems of high
  inflation, large budget deficit, and decaying infrastructure. His
  economic program suggests that although he will shun his expansionary
  policies of the 1980s, he will avoid tough measures needed to slow
  inflation or reduce the state's role in the economy. He has limited
  the previous government's privatization plans, for example, and has
  called for generous welfare spending and real wage increases. In 1994,
  the GDP growth rate is likely to remain low, and inflation probably
  will accelerate, remaining the highest in the EU. PAPANDREOU'S failure
  to improve the country's economic performance will further strain
  relations with the EU. Since Greece's accession to the then EC in
  1981, Athens' heavy reliance on EU aid - amounting to about 6% of
  Greek GDP annually - and its poor use of Union funds have riled
  Brussels. Its ailing economy will continue to be a drag on European
  economic and monetary union.

@Greenland, Economy

Overview: 
  Greenland's economic situation at present is difficult. Unemployment
  is increasing, and prospects for economic growth in the immediate
  future are dim. Following the closing of the Black Angel lead and zinc
  mine in 1989, Greenland became almost completely dependent on fishing
  and fish processing, the sector accounting for 95% of exports.
  Prospects for fisheries are not bright, as the important shrimp
  catches will at best stabilize and cod catches have dropped.
  Resumption of mining and hydrocarbon activities is not around the
  corner, thus leaving only tourism with some potential for the near
  future. The public sector in Greenland, i.e., the central government
  and its commercial entities and the municipalities, plays a dominant
  role in Greenland accounting for about two-thirds of total employment.
  About half the government's revenues come from grants from the Danish
  Government.
