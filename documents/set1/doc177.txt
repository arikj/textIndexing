Economy

Economy - overview: India's economy is a mixture of traditional
village farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of
modern industries, and a multitude of support services. A large share
of the population, perhaps as much as 40%, remains too poor to afford
an adequate diet. The policy in the 1980s of fueling economic growth
through high government expenditure proved unsustainable, however, and
in the wake of an international payments crisis in 1991 India has been
transforming its semi-socialist, insular economy into a more open,
market-oriented economy. Production, trade, and investment reforms
since 1991 have provided new opportunities for Indian businesspersons
and an estimated 200 million plus middle class consumers. New Delhi
has stimulated exports, attracted foreign investment, and revived
confidence in India's economic prospects. GDP growth exceeded 6% in
1995 and in 1996. Most of the country's external fundamentals -
including the current account balance and reserves (now about $19
billion) - are healthy. Even so, the Indian Government needs to
restore the early momentum of reform, especially by continuing
reductions in the extensive remaining government regulations. The
government will also have to deal with rising government expenditures
and higher debt servicing which could create a debt trap by the turn
of the century. Even if a series of weak coalition governments come to
power in the next few years and are unable to push reforms
aggressively, parts of the economy that have already benefited from
deregulation will continue to grow. Moreover, the country can build on
other strengths, including its diverse industrial base, large
scientific and technical pool, its well-developed legal system, and
its large middle class.

improvement is taking place with the recent admission of private and
private-public investors, but demand for communication services is
also growing rapidly

electromechanical and manual switchboard systems; within the last 10
years a substantial amount of digital switch gear has been introduced
for local service; long-distance traffic is carried mostly by open

of fiber-optic cable and a domestic satellite system with over 100
earth stations

Economy

Economy - overview: The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes
connecting the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the
Americas. It carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and
petroleum products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and
Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the
bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing
fleets from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian
Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are
being tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and
western Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil
production comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy
minerals and offshore placer deposits are actively exploited by
bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri
Lanka, and Thailand.

Economy

Economy - overview: Indonesia's sound macroeconomic management,
combined with an emphasis on rapid deregulation and encouragement of
private investment resulted in real GDP growth in 1991-96 averaging
about 7%. This was impressive, but not sufficient to cut
underemployment while absorbing the 2.3 million workers annually
entering the labor force. Foreign investment has boosted manufacturing
output and exports in recent years. The economy's growth is driven by
continuing expansion of nonoil exports. Plantation crops - rubber and
palm oil - and textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both
export and job generation. Industrial output is based on diverse
natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas, timber, metals,
and coal. Japan remains Indonesia's most important customer and
supplier of aid. Growth in 1996 was led by industry, transport, and
tourism. Strong growth should continue in 1997 assuming no sharp rise
in political uncertainty.

Economy

Economy - overview: Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning,
state ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village
agriculture, and small-scale private trading and service ventures.
Under President RAFSANJANI, the government adopted a number of market
reforms to reduce the state's role in the economy, but most of these
changes have moved slowly or have been reversed because of political
opposition. In the early 1990s, Iran experienced a financial crisis
caused by an import surge that began in 1989 and general financial
mismanagement. In 1993-1994, Iran rescheduled $15 billion in debt,
with the bulk of payments due in 1996-97. The strong oil market in
1996 has helped ease financial pressures, however, and Tehran has so
far made timely debt service payments. In 1996, Iran's oil earnings -
which account for 85% of total export revenues - climbed 20% from the
previous year. Iran's financial situation will remain tight through
the end of the decade, and continued timely debt service payments will
depend, in part, on persistent strong oil prices during the next few
years.

in 1990 but are still trying to work out written agreements settling
outstanding disputes from their eight-year war concerning border
demarcation, prisoners-of-war, and freedom of navigation and
sovereignty over the Shatt al-Arab waterway; Iran occupies two islands
in the Persian Gulf claimed by the UAE: Lesser Tunb (called Tunb as
Sughra in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Kuchek in Persian by
Iran) and Greater Tunb (called Tunb al Kubra in Arabic by UAE and
Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Bozorg in Persian by Iran); it jointly administers
with the UAE an island in the Persian Gulf claimed by the UAE (called
Abu Musa in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Abu Musa in Persian by Iran)
- over which Iran has taken steps to exert unilateral control since
1992, including access restrictions and a military build-up on the
island; the UAE has garnered significant diplomatic support in the
region in protesting these Iranian actions; Caspian Sea boundaries are
not yet determined among Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakstan, Russia, and
Turkmenistan

Economy

Economy - overview: The Ba'thist regime engages in extensive central
planning and management of industrial production and foreign trade
while leaving some small-scale industry and services and most
agriculture to private enterprise. The economy has been dominated by
the oil sector, which has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign
exchange earnings. In the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive
expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export
facilities by Iran, led the government to implement austerity measures
and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments; Iraq
suffered economic losses of at least $100 billion from the war. After
the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with
the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged
facilities. Agricultural development remained hampered by labor
shortages, salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land
reform and collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although
accorded high priority by the government, also was under financial
constraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent
international economic embargoes, and military action by an
international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically changed
the economic picture. Industrial and transportation facilities, which
suffered severe damage, have been partially restored. Oil exports are
at 25% of the prewar level following the implementation of UN Security
Council Resolution 986 in December 1996. Shortages of spare parts
continue. The UN-sponsored economic embargo has reduced exports and
imports and has contributed to the sharp rise in prices. The Iraqi
Government has been unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so that the
economic embargo could be removed. The government's policies of
supporting large military and internal security forces and of
allocating resources to key supporters of the regime have exacerbated
shortages. In accord with a UN resolution Iraq agreed to an
oil-for-food deal in 1996, under which it would export $2 billion
worth of oil in exchange for badly needed food and medicine. The first
oil was pumped in December 1996, and the first supplies of food and
medicine should arrive in March 1997. Per capita output for 1995-96
and living standards are well below the 1989-90 level, but any
estimates have a wide range of error.
