@Burkina:Economy

 Overview: One of the poorest countries in the world, Burkina has a
 high population density and a high population growth rate, few natural
 resources, and a fragile soil. Economic development is hindered by a
 poor communications network within a landlocked country. Agriculture
 provides about 40% of GDP and is mainly of a subsistence nature.
 Industry, dominated by unprofitable government-controlled
 corporations, accounts for about 15% of GDP. Following the 50%
 currency devaluation in January 1994, the government updated its
 development program in conjunction with international agencies. Even
 with the best of plans, however, the government faces formidable
 problems on all sides.

@Burma:Economy

 Overview: Burma has a mixed economy with about 75% private activity,
 mainly in agriculture, light industry, and transport, and with about
 25% state-controlled activity, mainly in energy, heavy industry, and
 foreign trade. Government policy in the last six years, 1989-94, has
 aimed at revitalizing the economy after four decades of tight central
 planning. Thus, private activity has markedly increased; foreign
 investment has been encouraged, so far with moderate success; and
 efforts continue to increase the efficiency of state enterprises.
 Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly understated
 because of the volume of black market trade. A major ongoing problem
 is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal stability. Although
 Burma remains a poor Asian country, its rich resources furnish the
 potential for substantial long-term increases in income, exports, and
 living standards.

@Burundi:Economy

 Overview: A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of
 economic development, Burundi since October 1993 has suffered from
 massive ethnic-based violence that has displaced an estimated million
 people, disrupted production, and set back needed reform programs.
 Burundi is predominately agricultural with roughly 90% of the
 population dependent on subsistence agriculture. Its economic health
 depends on the coffee crop, which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange
 earnings. The ability to pay for imports therefore continues to rest
 largely on the vagaries of the climate and the international coffee
 market. As part of its economic reform agenda, launched in February
 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi is trying to diversify
 its agricultural exports, attract foreign investment in industry, and
 modernize government budgetary practices. Although the government
 remains committed to reforms, it fears new austerity measures would
 add to ethnic tensions.

@Cambodia:Economy

 Overview: The Cambodian economy - virtually destroyed by decades of
 war - is slowly recovering. Government leaders are moving toward
 restoring fiscal and monetary discipline and have established good
 working relations with international financial institutions. Growth,
 starting from a low base, has been strong in 1991-94. Despite such
 positive developments, the reconstruction effort faces many tough
 challenges because of the persistence of internal political divisions
 and the related lack of confidence of foreign investors. Rural
 Cambodia, where 90% of about 9.5 million Khmer live, remains mired in
 poverty. The almost total lack of basic infrastructure in the
 countryside will hinder development and will contribute to a growing
 imbalance in growth between urban and rural areas over the near term.
 Moreover, the government's lack of experience in administering
 economic and technical assistance programs and rampant corruption
 among officials will slow the growth of critical public sector
 investment. Inflation for 1994 as a whole was less than a quarter of
 the 1992 rate and was declining during the year.

@Cameroon:Economy

 Overview: Because of its offshore oil resources and favorable
 agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed, most
 diversified primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still,
 it faces many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped
 countries, such as political instability, a top-heavy civil service,
 and a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. The
 development of the oil sector led rapid economic growth between 1970
 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986, precipitated by steep
 declines in the prices of major exports: coffee, cocoa, and petroleum.
 Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and inefficiencies in
 fiscal management were exposed. In 1990-93, with support from the IMF
 and World Bank, the government began to introduce reforms designed to
 spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, and
 recapitalize the nation's banks. Political instability, following
 suspect elections in 1992, brought IMF/WB structural adjustment to a
 halt. Although the 50% devaluation of the currency in January 1994
 improved the potential for export growth, mismanagement remains and is
 the main barrier to economic improvement.

@Canada:Economy

 Overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today
 closely resembles the US in per capita output, market-oriented
 economic system, and pattern of production. Since World War II the
 impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors
 has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one
 primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada registered one of
 the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations, averaging
 about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and
 modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects,
 although the country still faces high unemployment and a growing debt.
 Moreover, the continuing constitutional impasse between English- and
 French-speaking areas has observers discussing a possible split in the
 confederation; foreign investors have become edgy.
