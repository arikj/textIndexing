@Nicaragua, Economy

Overview: 
  Since March 1991, when President CHAMORRO began an ambitious economic
  stabilization program, Nicaragua has had considerable success in
  reducing inflation and obtaining substantial economic aid from abroad.
  Annual inflation fell from more than 750% in 1991 to less than 5% in
  1992. Inflation rose again to an estimated 20% in 1993, although this
  increase was due almost entirely to a large currency devaluation in
  January. As of early 1994, the government was close to finalizing an
  enhanced structural adjustment facility with the IMF, after the
  previous standby facility expired in early 1993. Despite these
  successes, achieving overall economic growth in an economy scarred by
  misguided economic values and civil war during the 1980s has proved
  elusive. Economic growth was flat in 1992 and slightly negative in
  1993. Nicaragua's per capita foreign debt is one of the highest in the
  world; nonetheless, as of late 1993, Nicaragua was current on its
  post-1988 debt as well as on payments to the international financial
  institutions. Definition of property rights remains a problem;
  ownership disputes over large tracts of land, businesses, and homes
  confiscated by the previous government have yet to be resolved.

@Niger, Economy

Overview: 
  Niger's economy is centered on subsistence agriculture, animal
  husbandry, and re-export trade, and increasingly less on uranium, its
  major export throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Uranium revenues dropped
  by almost 50% between 1983 and 1990. Terms of trade with Nigeria,
  Niger's largest regional trade partner, have improved dramatically
  since the 50% devaluation of the African franc in January 1994; this
  devaluation boosted exports of livestock, peas, onions, and the
  products of Niger's small cotton industry. The government relies on
  bilateral and multilateral aid for operating expenses and public
  investment, and is strongly induced to adhere to structural adjustment
  programs designed by the IMF and the World Bank.

@Nigeria, Economy

Overview: 
  The oil-rich Nigerian economy continues to be hobbled by poor
  macroeconomic management that has resulted in an average annual
  inflation rate of 60%, a growing foreign debt, and a worsening balance
  of payments. A deepening political crisis in 1993 has compounded the
  government's failure to reign in deficit spending, which prevents it
  from reaching an agreement with the IMF and its bilateral creditors on
  debt relief. Investment in both oil and non-oil sector industry has
  been undermined by corruption and squandered on white elephant
  projects that have failed to generate diversification or new
  employment.

@Niue, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New Zealand. Government
  expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall made up by
  grants from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages to public
  employees. The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence
  gardening, although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry
  consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit, lime
  oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign
  collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent
  years has suffered a serious loss of population because of migration
  of Niueans to New Zealand.

@Northern Mariana Islands, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy benefits substantially from financial assistance from the
  US. The rate of funding has declined as locally generated government
  revenues have grown. An agreement for the years 1986 to 1992 entitled
  the islands to $228 million for capital development, government
  operations, and special programs. A rapidly growing major source of
  income is the tourist industry, which now employs about 50% of the
  work force. Japanese tourists predominate. The agricultural sector is
  made up of cattle ranches and small farms producing coconuts,
  breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons. Industry is small scale, mostly
  handicrafts and light manufacturing.
