@Colombia:Economy

 Overview: Colombia's economy has grown steadily since 1991, when the
 government implemented sweeping economic reform measures. President
 SAMPER, who took office in August 1994, has pledged to maintain those
 reforms while expanding government assistance for poor Colombians, who
 continue to make up about 40% of the population. In an effort to bring
 down inflation, SAMPER has arranged a "social pact" with business and
 labor to curtail price hikes and trim inflation to 18%. The rapid
 development of oil, coal, and other nontraditional industries, along
 with copious inflows of capital and strengthening of prices for
 coffee, have helped keep growth at 5%-6%. Development of the massive
 Cusiana oilfield provides the means to sustain this level over the
 next several years. Exporters say, however, that their sales have been
 hampered by the appreciation of the Colombian peso, and farmers have
 sought government help in adjusting to greater foreign competition.
 Moreover, increased foreign investment and even greater domestic
 growth have been hindered by an inadequate energy and transportation
 infrastructure and by violence stemming from drug trafficking and
 persistent rural insurgency.

@Comoros:Economy

 Overview: One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of
 several islands that have poor transportation links, a young and
 rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low
 educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence
 level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence
 on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including
 fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the economy.
 It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and
 provides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient in
 food production; rice, the main staple, accounts for 90% of imports.
 The government is struggling to upgrade education and technical
 training, to privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, to
 improve health services, to diversify exports, and to reduce the high
 population growth rate. Continued foreign support is essential if the
 goal of 4% annual GDP growth is to be reached in the late 1990s.

 est.)

 National product real growth rate: 0.9% (1994 est.)

@Congo:Economy

 Overview: Congo's economy is a mixture of village agriculture and
 handicrafts, an industrial sector based largely on oil, support
 services, and a government characterized by budget problems and
 overstaffing. A reform program, supported by the IMF and World Bank,
 ran into difficulties in 1990-91 because of problems in changing to a
 democratic political regime and a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has
 supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing about
 two-thirds of government revenues and exports. In the early 1980s
 rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to finance large-scale
 development projects with growth averaging 5% annually, one of the
 highest rates in Africa. Subsequently, growth has slowed to an average
 of roughly 1.5% annually, only two-thirds of the population growth
 rate. Political turmoil and misguided government investment have
 derailed economic reform programs sponsored by the IMF and World Bank.
 Even with these difficulties Congo enjoys one of the highest incomes
 per capita in sub-Saharan Africa

@Cook Islands:Economy

 Overview: Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export
 earners are fruit, copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are
 limited to a fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories.
 Economic development is hindered by the isolation of the islands from
 foreign markets and a lack of natural resources and good
 transportation links. A large trade deficit is annually made up for by
 remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid, largely from New
