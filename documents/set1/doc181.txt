Economy

Economy - overview: The government of Laos - one of the few remaining
official communist states - has been decentralizing control and
encouraging private enterprise since 1986. The results, starting from
an extremely low base, have been striking - growth has averaged 7.5%
annually since 1988. Even so, Laos is a landlocked country with a
primitive infrastructure. It has no railroads, a rudimentary road
system, and limited external and internal telecommunications.
Electricity is available in only a few urban areas. Subsistence
agriculture accounts for half of GDP and provides 80% of total
employment. The predominant crop is rice. In non-drought years, Laos
is self-sufficient overall in food, but each year flood, pests, and
localized drought cause shortages in various parts of the country. For
the foreseeable future the economy will continue to depend on aid from
the IMF and other international sources; aid from the former
USSR/Eastern Europe has been cut sharply. As in many developing
countries, deforestation and soil erosion will hamper efforts to
maintain the high rate of GDP growth.

Economy

Economy - overview: In the five years following the implosion of the
USSR in December 1991, the Latvian economy has made substantial
progress toward establishing a modern market economy and widening
economic ties with the West. Two major long-term concerns are the
growing trade deficit and the impact of organized crime. The economy
in 1996 has largely recovered from the mid-1995 collapse of several
commercial banks - including Latvia's large bank, Bank Baltija - and a
severe government budget crisis. Prime Minister SKELE has stated that
he expects the country's GDP to grow 5% in 1997 through the
implementation of the government's new economic reform program. In
December 1996, the government passed a balanced 1997 budget - its
first - that SKELE predicts will reduce inflation to 10% to 12% in
1997. Unemployment, which has held steady at about 6% over the past
two years, reached roughly 7.5% in 1996. One of SKELE's key objectives
for 1997 is to speed up the privatization program, which has lagged
behind other areas of reform.

LEBANON

Introduction

Current issues: Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its
political institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since
the end of the devastating 16-year civil war, which began in 1975.
Under the Ta'if Accord - the blueprint for national reconciliation -
the Lebanese have established a more equitable political system,
particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the political process.
Since the end of the civil war, the Lebanese have formed five cabinets
and conducted two legislative elections. Most of the militias have
been weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has seized
vast quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and
extended central government authority over about one-half of the
country. Hizballah, the radical Shi'a party, retains most of its
weapons. Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel
maintains troops in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy
militia, the Army of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of
territory contiguous to its border. The ASL's enclave encompasses this
self-declared security zone and about 20 kilometers north to the
strategic town of Jazzin. Syria maintains about 30,000 troops in
Lebanon. These troops are based mainly in Beirut, North Lebanon, and
the Bekaa Valley. Syria's deployment was legitimized by the Arab
League during Lebanon's civil war and in the Ta'if accord. Citing the
continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests, and failure of the
Lebanese Government to implement all of the constitutional reforms in
the Ta'if accord, Damascus has so far refused to withdraw its troops
from Lebanon.

Economy

Economy - overview: The 1975-91 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's
economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but
ended Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub.
Peace has enabled the central government to restore control in Beirut,
begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key port and government
facilities. Economic recovery has been helped by a financially sound
banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers,
with family remittances, banking services, manufactured and farm
exports, and international aid as the main sources of foreign
exchange. Lebanon's economy has made impressive gains since Prime
Minister HARIRI launched his $18 billion "Horizon 2000" reconstruction
program in 1993. Real GDP grew 8% in 1994 and 7% in 1995 before
Israel's Operation Grapes of Wrath in April 1996 stunted economic
activity. During 1992-96, annual inflation fell from more than 170% to
10%, and foreign exchange reserves jumped to more than $4 billion from
$1.4 billion. Burgeoning capital inflows have fueled foreign payments
surpluses, and the Lebanese pound has remained relatively stable.
Progress also has been made in rebuilding Lebanon's war-torn physical
and financial infrastructure. Solidere, a $2-billion firm, is managing
the reconstruction of Beirut's central business district, the stock
market reopened in January 1996, and international banks and insurance
companies are returning. The government nonetheless faces serious
challenges in the economic arena. The government has had to fund
reconstruction by tapping foreign exchange reserves and boosting
borrowing. The stalled peace process and ongoing violence in southern
Lebanon could spawn wider hostilities that would disrupt vital capital
inflows. Furthermore, the gap between rich and poor has widened since
HARIRI took office, sowing grassroots dissatisfaction over the skewed
distribution of reconstruction's benefits and leading the government
to shift its focus from rebuilding infrastructure to improving social
conditions.

Economy

Economy - overview: Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no
important natural resources other than water. Its economy is based on
agriculture, light manufacturing, and remittances from miners employed
in South Africa. The number of such mine workers has declined steadily
over the past five years; in 1996 their remittances added about 33% to
GDP compared with the addition of roughly 67% in 1990. The great
majority of households gain their livelihoods from subsistence farming
and migrant labor; a large portion of the adult male work force is
employed in South African mines. Manufacturing depends largely on farm
products which support the milling, canning, leather, and jute
industries. Although drought has decreased agricultural activity over
the past few years, completion of a major hydropower facility will
permit the sale of water to South Africa and will support the
economy's continued expansion. The pace of the privatization of
state-owned firms increased toward the end of 1994.

LIBERIA

Introduction

Current issues: Years of civil strife have destroyed much of Liberia's
economic infrastructure, made civil administration nearly impossible,
and brought economic activity virtually to a halt. The deterioration
of economic conditions has been greatly exacerbated by the flight of
most business people with their expertise and capital. Civil order
ended in 1990 when President Samuel Kenyon DOE was killed by rebel
forces. In April 1996, when forces loyal to faction leaders Charles
Ghankay TAYLOR and Alhaji KROMAH attacked rival ethnic Krahn factions,
the fighting further damaged Monrovia's dilapidated infrastructure.
Fighting waned in late May 1996, allowing West African peacekeepers to
regain control of Monrovia. The Abuja II peace accord was signed in
August 1996 replacing the Chairman of the ruling Council of State,
Wilton SANKAWULO, with Ruth PERRY. National elections were scheduled
for 30 May 1997, but long-term prospects for peace will remain poor
unless the warring factions can overcome their greed, mutual
suspicions and ethnic hatreds.

Economy

Economy - overview: Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of
Liberia's economy, especially the infrastructure in and around
Monrovia. Businessmen have fled the country, taking capital and
expertise with them. Many will not return. Richly endowed with water,
mineral resources, forests and a climate favorable to agriculture,
Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic products, while
local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope.
Political and economic instability - including the stripping of
resources by local warlords - threatens prospects for reconstruction
as well as the repatriation of an estimated 750,000 Liberian refugees
who have fled to neighboring countries. The continued political
turmoil has prevented restoration of normal economic life, including
the re-establishment of a strong central government with effective
economic development programs.
