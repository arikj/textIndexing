Economy

Economy - overview: Norway is a prosperous bastion of welfare
capitalism. The economy consists of a combination of free market
activity and government intervention. The government controls key
areas, such as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state
enterprises), and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and
areas with sparse resources. Norway maintains an extensive welfare
system that helps propel public sector expenditures to more than 50%
of GDP and results in one of the highest average tax levels in the
world (46%). A small country with a high dependence on international
trade, Norway is basically an exporter of raw materials and
semiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small- and medium-sized
firms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations. The country is
richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum, hydropower, fish,
forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on its oil sector.
Only Saudi Arabia exports more oil than Norway. Norway imports more
than half its food needs. Economic growth, only 1.6% in 1993, has
improved steadily over the past few years, resulting in a budget
surplus in 1996. Oslo opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum
in November 1994. Despite their high per capita income - outstripped
among major nations only by the US - and their generous welfare
benefits, the Norwegians worry about that time in the 21st century
when the oil and gas run out.

Economy

Economy - overview: Economic performance is closely tied to the
fortunes of the oil industry. Petroleum accounts for 75% of export
earnings and government revenues and for roughly 40% of GDP. Oman has
proved oil reserves of 4 billion barrels, equivalent to about 20
years' supply at the current rate of extraction. Agriculture is
carried on at a subsistence level and the general population depends
on imported food. The year 1996 was marked by higher oil production

PACIFIC OCEAN
[Map of Pacific Ocean]

@Pacific Ocean:Geography

Location: body of water between Antarctica, Asia, Australia, and the
Western Hemisphere

Geographic coordinates: 0 00 N, 160 00 W

Map references: World

Area:
total: 165.384 million sq km
note: includes Bali Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering Sea, Bering
Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Flores Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of
Tonkin, Java Sea, Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Savu Sea, Sea of Japan,
Sea of Okhotsk, South China Sea, Tasman Sea, Timor Sea, and other
tributary water bodies

Area - comparative: about 18 times the size of the US; the largest
ocean (followed by the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the
Arctic Ocean); covers about one-third of the global surface; larger
than the total land area of the world

Coastline: 135,663 km

Climate: planetary air pressure systems and resultant wind patterns
exhibit remarkable uniformity in the south and east; trade winds and
westerly winds are well-developed patterns, modified by seasonal
fluctuations; tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico
from June to October and affect Mexico and Central America;
continental influences cause climatic uniformity to be much less
pronounced in the eastern and western regions at the same latitude in
the North Pacific Ocean; the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy
season occurs during the summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow
from the ocean over the land, and a dry season during the winter
months, when dry winds blow from the Asian land mass back to the
ocean; tropical cyclones (typhoons) may strike southeast and East Asia
from May to December

Terrain: surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a
clockwise, warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in
the southern Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the
northern Pacific, sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk
in winter; in the southern Pacific, sea ice from Antarctica reaches
its northernmost extent in October; the ocean floor in the eastern
Pacific is dominated by the East Pacific Rise, while the western
Pacific is dissected by deep trenches, including the Marianas Trench,
which is the world's deepest

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Marianas Trench -10,924 m
highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources: oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and
gravel aggregates, placer deposits, fish

Natural hazards: surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and
earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the "Pacific Ring of
Fire"; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east
Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to October);
tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike
Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August
and September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from
Antarctica; occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of
Peru, when the trade winds slacken and the warm Equatorial
Countercurrent moves south, killing the plankton that is the primary
food source for anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move to better
feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds to starve by the
thousands because of the loss of their food source; ships subject to
superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May and in
extreme south from May to October; persistent fog in the northern
Pacific can be a maritime hazard from June to December

Environment - current issues: endangered marine species include the
dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution
in Philippine Sea and South China Sea

Environment - international agreements:
party to : none of the selected agreements
signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements

Geography - note: the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama
Canal, Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the
Pacific Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific
Ocean; dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in
the southwestern Pacific Ocean

Economy

Economy - overview: The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the
world economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly
touch. It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West,
extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and
sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%)
of the world's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the
only ocean where the fish catch has increased every year since 1978.
Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an
ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of Australia, NZ, China,
US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas,
combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has
slowed but not stopped new drillings.

Economy

Economy - overview: Pakistan is a poor, highly populated Third World
country struggling to make the difficult transition to the modern
world of high technology and international markets. Even though GDP
growth has remained strong, at roughly 5% annually, international
confidence in Prime Minister Benazir BHUTTO's government declined in
1996. The IMF suspended a Standby Agreement in the spring; foreign
investment declined; and the budget and trade deficits rose
substantially. In October 1996, BHUTTO responded to IMF pressure to
implement reforms, devaluing the rupee by about 8% and raising
petroleum prices in an attempt to slow the drain on foreign exchange
reserves. But Islamabad still failed to meet IMF revenue and borrowing
targets. Pakistan's interim government - in power since President
LEGHARI sacked BHUTTO on 5 November 1996 - agreed to slash the budget
deficit, push down bank borrowing, implement an agricultural tax; and
speed up reforms in the financial sector; accordingly, the Standby
Agreement was reinstated in December 1996 and a tranche of $80 million
released; but Pakistan fell out of compliance in February 1997. For
the long run, Pakistan must deal with serious problems of
deteriorating infrastructure, low literacy levels, and persistent
sectarian and political violence.

Economy

Economy - overview: The economy consists primarily of subsistence
agriculture and fishing. The government is the major employer of the
work force, relying heavily on financial assistance from the US. The
population, in effect, enjoys a per capita income of $5,000, twice
that of the Philippines and much of Micronesia. Long-run prospects for
the tourist sector have been greatly bolstered by the expansion of air
travel in the Pacific and the rapidly rising prosperity of leading
East Asian countries. Reducing budgeted operating expenditures - which
have increased 56% from 1989 to 1993 - will be the biggest challenge
for the government over the next several years.
