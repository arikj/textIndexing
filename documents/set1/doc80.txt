@Guyana, Economy

Overview: 
  Guyana, one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, has
  pushed ahead strongly in 1991-93, at 7% average annual growth rate.
  Favorable factors include recovery in the key agricultural and mining
  sectors, a more favorable atmosphere for business initiative, a more
  realistic exchange rate, a sharp drop in the inflation rate, and the
  continued support of international organizations. Serious underlying
  economic problems will continue. Electric power has been in short
  supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in national
  output. The government will have to persist in efforts to control
  external debt and inflation and to extend the privatization program.
National product: 
  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $1.4 billion (1993 est.)
National product real growth rate:

@Haiti, Economy

Overview: 
  About 75% of the population live in abject poverty. Agriculture is
  mainly small-scale subsistence farming and employs nearly
  three-fourths of the work force. The majority of the population does
  not have ready access to safe drinking water, adequate medical care,
  or sufficient food. Few social assistance programs exist, and the lack
  of employment opportunities remains one of the most critical problems
  facing the economy, along with soil erosion and political instability.
  Trade sanctions applied by the Organization of American States in
  response to the September 1991 coup against President ARISTIDE have
  further damaged the economy. Output continued to drop in 1993 although
  not as sharply as in 1992.

@Honduras, Economy

Overview: 
  Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.
  Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy, accounts for
  more than 25% of GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and produces
  two-thirds of exports. Productivity remains low. Industry, still in
  its early stages, employs nearly 9% of the labor force, accounts for
  15% of GDP, and generates 20% of exports. The service sectors,
  including public administration, account for 50% of GDP and employ 20%
  of the labor force. Basic problems facing the economy include rapid
  population growth, high unemployment, a lack of basic services, a
  large and inefficient public sector, and the dependence of the export
  sector mostly on coffee and bananas, which are subject to sharp price
  fluctuations. A far-reaching reform program initiated by former
  President CALLEJAS in 1990 is beginning to take hold. In 1993 the
  large fiscal deficit emerged as a key economic problem, the result of
  improvident state spending.

@Hong Kong, Economy

Overview: 
  Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few tariffs or
  nontariff barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food and raw
  materials must be imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 17% of
  GDP. Goods and services exports account for about 50% of GDP. Real GDP
  growth averaged a remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90,
  and picked up to 4.2% in 1991, 5.0% in 1992, and 5.2% in 1993.
  Unemployment, which has been declining since the mid-1980s, is now
  about 2%. A shortage of labor continues to put upward pressure on
  prices and the cost of living. Short-term prospects remain bright so
  long as major trading partners continue to be reasonably prosperous.
