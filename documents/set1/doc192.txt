Economy

Economy - overview: The economy has traditionally been based on
agriculture. Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a
century, and in some years it accounts for 85% of exports. The
government has been pushing the development of a tourist industry to
relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third of the
labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is
extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The
white and Indian communities are substantially better off than other
segments of the population, often approaching European standards,
whereas indigenous groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical
of the poorer nations of the African continent. The outbreak of severe
rioting in February 1991 illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic
tensions. The economic well-being of Reunion depends heavily on
continued financial assistance from France.

Economy

Economy - overview: Romania, one of the poorer countries in Central
and Eastern Europe, began the transition from Communism with a largely
obsolete industrial base and a pattern of output unsuited to the
country's needs. Over the past seven years, economic restructuring has
lagged behind most other countries in the region. Consequently,
economic performance is declining, with slowing GDP growth, ballooning
budget deficits, accelerating inflation, a plunging exchange rate, and
anemic foreign investment. Unemployment was low at about 6% at the end
of 1996, but the rate will rise when restructuring gets underway. A
new government elected in November 1996 promises to accelerate
economic reform, restructuring, and privatization, introduce fiscal
and monetary austerity, reduce the state's role in the economy, and
open Romania to foreign investment. The government will tackle its
formidable economic problems in two stages, with an emergency plan
over the winter of 1996/97 to ensure social and political stability,
followed by a radical structural reform program over its remaining
three-and-one-half years aimed eventually at EU accession. At the same
time, it wants to keep campaign promises to increase benefits to
disadvantaged groups. Bucharest hopes to receive financial and
technical assistance from international financial institutions and
western governments and negotiations over a new IMF standby agreement
are underway. If reform stalls, however, Romania's bond rating - just
below investment grade - could fall and needed capital from both
public and private sources could quickly dry up. Rich agricultural and
oil resources are strengths for the future.

Economy

Economy - overview: Russia, a vast country with a wealth of natural
resources, a well-educated population, and a diverse, but declining,
industrial base, continues to experience formidable difficulties in
moving from its old centrally planned economy to a modern market
economy. Most of 1996 was a lost year for economic reforms, with
government officials focused in the first half of the year on
President YEL'TSIN's reelection and then on his medical problems. The
only major success was in the fight against inflation, which fell from
131% in 1995 to 22% in 1996. Russia failed to make any progress in
restructuring its social welfare programs to target the most needy -
among whom are many of the old pensioners - or to pass needed tax
reform. While approximately 75% of industry has now been privatized,
the agricultural sector has undergone little reform since the break-up
of the Soviet Union. Stockholder rights remain weak while crime and
corruption are rampant in much of the economy. Many enterprises
continue to operate without hard budget constraints, resulting in
barter trade and increased inter-enterprise debts. According to
official statistics, the Russian economy declined for the fifth
straight year since the beginning of reforms, with GDP in 1996 falling
by 6% and industrial output by 5%. The true size of the Russian
economy remains controversial, however, with estimates of unreported
economic activity ranging from 20%-50% of GDP. Indeed, according to
Russian statistics, the Russian consumer has seen a small improvement
in the last several years, with real average incomes growing by about
8% from early 1993 to late 1996. The share of the Russian population
living below the poverty line is said to have dropped from one-third
in early 1993 to one-fifth in late 1996. Few Russians lack basic
necessities, and ownership of consumer goods such as VCRs and
automobiles has increased markedly. The growth of wage and pension
arrears slowed in the second half of 1996, and the government pledged
to clear all budget-funded wage and pension arrears by the end of
1997. The government continued to be plagued with tax collection
problems during 1996, forcing it to cut its planned spending by 18%. A
crackdown on major tax debtors at the end of the year had only limited
success. Spending by all levels of government remains high, between
40%-45% of GDP. The economy is continuing its integration into world
markets. Russia's trade surplus, after adjustment for unreported
"shuttle" trade, grew to a record $28.5 billion in 1996, according to
official Russian statistics. Export growth, which slowed from 18% to
9%, was due mostly to increased raw material prices. After increasing
by 15% in 1995, imports dipped by 2% in 1996 as Russian demand for
Western consumer goods slackened. Russia is continuing to make
progress in its WTrO negotiations; the government has made quick
accession one of its major policy goals. The continued unsettled
economic and political situation has discouraged foreign investment,
which totaled only $6.5 billion in 1996, including $2.1 billion in
direct investment; furthermore, capital flight continues to exceed in
volume the inflow of foreign capital. The central bank estimates that
$30 billion in US currency circulates in the Russian economy. In March
1997, YEL'TSIN signaled his intention to restart stalled economic
reforms by reorganizing the cabinet, bringing in a new team of
ministers with strong reform credentials.

enlisting foreign help, by means of joint ventures, to speed up the
modernization of its telecommunications system; in 1992, only 661,000
new telephones were installed compared with 855,000 in 1991, and in
1992 the number of unsatisfied applications for telephones reached

Independent States; a new Russian Intersputnik satellite will link
Moscow and St. Petersburg with Rome from whence calls will be relayed

territory in the Narva and Pechora regions - based on boundary
established under the 1920 Peace Treaty of Tartu; based on the 1920
Treaty of Riga, Latvia had claimed the Abrene/Pytalovo section of the

Economy

Economy - overview: Rwanda is a poor African nation suffering bitterly
from ethnic-based civil war. The agricultural sector dominates the
economy; coffee and tea normally make up 80%-90% of exports. The
amount of fertile land is limited, however, and deforestation and soil
erosion continue to reduce the production potential. Manufacturing
focuses mainly on the processing of agricultural products. A
structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in October
1990. Ethnic-based insurgency since 1990 has devastated wide areas,
especially in the north, and displaced hundreds of thousands of
people. A peace accord in mid-1993 temporarily ended most of the
fighting, but resumption of large-scale civil warfare in April 1994 in
the capital city Kigali and elsewhere took 500,000 lives in that year
alone and severely damaged already poor economic prospects. Sketchy
data suggest that GDP dropped 50% in 1994 and came back partially, by
25%, in 1995. Plentiful rains helped agriculture in 1996, and outside
aid continued to support this desperately poor economy. The economy
continues to suffer massively from failure to maintain the
infrastructure, looting, neglect of important cash crops, and lack of
health care facilities. Because of the accumulated damage to capital
plant and the decline in public discipline, recovery of domestic
production will proceed slowly.
