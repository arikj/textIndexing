@Bahrain, Economy

Overview: 
  Petroleum production and processing account for about 80% of export
  receipts, 60% of government revenues, and 30% of GDP. Economic
  conditions have fluctuated with the changing fortunes of oil since
  1985, for example, during and following the Gulf crisis of 1990-91.
  Bahrain with its highly developed communication and transport
  facilities is home to numerous multinational firms with business in
  the Gulf. A large share of exports consists of petroleum products made
  from imported crude. Prospects for 1994 are good, with private
  enterprise the main driving force, e.g., in banking and construction.

@Bangladesh, Economy

Overview: 
  Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest, most densely populated, and
  least developed nations. Its economy is overwhelmingly agricultural,
  with the cultivation of rice the single most important activity in the
  economy. Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and
  floods, government interference with the economy, a rapidly growing
  labor force that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, a low level of
  industrialization, failure to fully exploit energy resources (natural
  gas), and inefficient and inadequate power supplies. Excellent rice
  crops and expansion of the export garment industry helped growth in
  FY92 and FY93. Policy reforms intended to reduce government regulation
  of private industry and promote public-sector efficiency have been
  announced but are being implemented only slowly.

@Barbados, Economy

Overview: 
  A per capita income of $8,700 gives Barbados one of the highest
  standards of living of all the small island states of the eastern
  Caribbean. Historically, the economy was based on the cultivation of
  sugar cane and related activities. In recent years, however, the
  economy has diversified into manufacturing and tourism. The tourist
  industry is now a major employer of the labor force and a primary
  source of foreign exchange. The economy slowed in 1990-92 as
  Bridgetown's difficulty in financing its deficits caused it to exert
  control over domestic demands

@Belarus, Economy
Overview: 
  Belarus ranks among the most developed of the former Soviet states,
  with a relatively modern - by Soviet standards - and diverse machine
  building sector and a robust agriculture sector. It also serves as a
  transport link for Russian oil exports to the Baltic states and
  Eastern and Western Europe. The breakup of the Soviet Union and its
  command economy has resulted in a sharp economic contraction as
  traditional trade ties have collapsed. At the same time, the
  Belarusian Government has lagged behind most other former Soviet
  states in economic reform; privatization has barely begun; the
  agriculture sector remains highly subsidized; the state retains
  control over many prices; and the system of state orders and
  distribution persists. Meanwhile, the national bank continues to pour
  credits into inefficient enterprises, fueling inflation and weakening
  incentives to improve performance. The government is pinning its hopes
  on reintegration with the Russian economy, but such a path would only
  partially restore traditional trade ties. Until economic reform is
  embraced, Belarus will continue in its economic morass.
National product: 
  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $61 billion (1993 estimate from
  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and
  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993; and as

  very uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)
