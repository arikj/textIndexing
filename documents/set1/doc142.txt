@Sierra Leone:Economy

 Overview: Sierra Leone has substantial mineral, agricultural, and
 fishery resources, but the economic and social infrastructure is not
 well developed. Agriculture generates about 40% of GDP and employs
 about two-thirds of the working population, with subsistence
 agriculture dominating the sector. Manufacturing, which accounts for
 roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of the processing of raw materials
 and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining
 provides an important source of hard currency. Since 1990, the
 government has been able to meet its IMF- and World Bank-mandated
 stabilization targets, holding down fiscal deficits, increasing
 foreign exchange reserves, and retiring much of its domestic debt -
 but at a steep cost in terms of capital investments and social
 spending. Moreover, the economic infrastructure has nearly collapsed
 due to neglect and war-related disruptions in the mining and
 agricultural export sectors. The continuing civil war in Liberia has
 led to a large influx of refugees, who place additional burdens on
 Sierra Leon's fragile economy.

@Singapore:Economy

 Overview: Singapore has an open entrepreneurial economy with strong
 service and manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading
 links derived from its entrepot history. The economy registered 10.1%
 growth in 1994, with prospects for 7.5%-8.5% growth in 1995. In 1994,
 the manufacturing and financial and business services sectors have led
 economic growth. Exports boomed, led by the electronics sector,
 particularly US demand for disk drives. Rising labor costs continue to
 be a threat to Singapore's competitiveness, but there are indications
 that productivity is keeping up. In applied technology, per capita
 output, investment, and labor discipline, Singapore has key attributes
 of a developed country.

@Slovakia:Economy

 Overview: In 1994 macroeconomic performance improved steadily but
 privatization progressed only in fits and starts. Most of Slovakia's
 IMF-approved targets were met by an interim government that lasted 9
 months. Annual inflation fell from 23% in 1993 to 12%; unemployment at
 14.6% was still well below forecasts of 17%; and the budget deficit
 was around half that in 1993. Slovakia's nearly $200 million trade
 surplus also compares favorably with a more than $800 million deficit
 in 1993. Furthermore, after contracting almost 25% in the three years
 following 1990, GDP grew 4.3% in 1994, according to official
 statistics. Bratislava in June qualified for a $254 million IMF
 stand-by loan and the second $90 million tranche of its Systemic
 Transformation Facility and, in December, received approval for a
 European Union loan worth about $160 million. By the end of September
 1994, the Central Bank's foreign currency reserves had tripled since
 the end of 1993. Slovakia continued to have difficulty attracting
 foreign investment, however, because of perceived political
 instability and halting progress in privatization. The interim
 government prepared property worth nearly $2 billion for the second
 wave of coupon privatization and sold participation in the program to
 over 80% of Slovakia's eligible citizens. Parties controlling the new
 Parliament in November 1994, however, put the second wave of coupon
 privatization on hold and suspended sales of 38 firms until the new
 government could evaluate the interim government's decisions in early
 1995. The new government's targets for 1995 include GDP growth of 3%,
 inflation of 8%-10%, unemployment of 15%, and a budget deficit under
 3% of GDP. Continuing economic recovery in western Europe should boost
 Slovak exports and production, but Slovakia's image with foreign
 creditors and investors could suffer setbacks in 1995 if progress on
 privatization stalls or budget deficits mount beyond IMF-recommended
 levels.

@Slovenia:Economy

 Overview: Slovenia appears to be making a solid economic recovery,
 fulfilling the promise it showed at the time of Yugoslavia's breakup.
 It was by far the most prosperous of the former Yugoslav republics,
 with a per capita income more than twice the national average. It also
 benefited from strong ties to Western Europe and suffered
 comparatively small physical damage in the dismemberment process. The
 beginning was difficult, however. Real GDP fell 15% during 1991-92,
 while inflation jumped to 247% in 1991 and unemployment topped 8% -
 nearly three times the 1989 level. The turning point came in 1993 when
 real GDP grew 1%, unemployment leveled off at about 9%, and inflation
 slowed dramatically to 23%. In 1994, the rate of growth of GDP rose to
 4%, unemployment remained stable, and inflation dropped to 20%. This
 was accomplished, moreover, without balance-of-payments problems. The
 government gets generally good economic marks from foreign observers,
 particularly with regard to fiscal policy - the budget deficit in 1994
 was only about 1% of GDP, following several years of small surpluses.
 Prospects for 1995 appear good, with economic growth expected to
 remain strong while unemployment and inflation may decline slightly.
 Privatization, sluggish to date, is expected to pick up in 1995.

@Somalia:Economy

 Overview: One of the world's poorest and least developed countries,
 Somalia has few resources. Moreover, much of the economy has been
 devastated by the civil war. Agriculture is the most important sector,
 with livestock accounting for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export
 earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for
 their livelihood make up about 70% of the population. Crop production
 generates only 10% of GDP and employs about 20% of the work force. The
 main export crop is bananas; sugar, sorghum, and corn are grown for
 the domestic market. The small industrial sector is based on the
 processing of agricultural products and accounts for less than 10% of
 GDP; most facilities have been shut down because of the civil strife.
 The greatly increased political turmoil of 1991-93 has resulted in a
 substantial drop in agricultural output, with widespread famine. In
 1994 economic conditions stabilized in the countryside but may turn
 worse in 1995 if civil strife intensifies after the UN withdrawal.
