 production caused by drought. The government has been relatively

@Sao Tome And Principe:Economy

 Overview: This small poor island economy has remained dependent on
 cocoa since independence 20 years ago. Since then, however, cocoa
 production has gradually declined because of drought and
 mismanagement, so that by 1987 annual output had fallen from 10,000
 tons to 3,900 tons. As a result, a shortage of cocoa for export has
 created a serious balance-of-payments problem. Production of less
 important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm kernels, has also
 declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of exports by a
 ratio of 4:1 or more. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense
 of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of food
 needs. It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods.
 Over the years, Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt
 and has had to depend on concessional aid and debt rescheduling.
 Considerable potential exists for development of a tourist industry,
 and the government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent
 years. The government also has attempted to reduce price controls and
 subsidies and to encourage market-based mechanisms, e. g., to
 facilitate the distribution of imported food. Annual GDP growth is
 estimated in the 3%-4% range for 1994-96.

@Saudi Arabia:Economy

 Overview: This is a well-to-do oil-based economy with strong
 government controls over major economic activities. About 46% of GDP
 comes from the private sector. Economic (as well as political) ties
 with the US are especially strong. The petroleum sector accounts for
 roughly 75% of budget revenues, 35% of GDP, and almost all export
 earnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves of petroleum in the
 world (26% of the proved total), ranks as the largest exporter of
 petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the
 government intends to bring its budget, which has been in deficit
 since 1983, back into balance, and to encourage private economic
 activity. Roughly four million foreign workers play an important role
 in the Saudi economy, for example, in the oil and banking sectors. For
 about a decade, Saudi Arabia's domestic and international outlays have
 outstripped its income, and the government has cut its foreign
 assistance and is beginning to rein in domestic programs. For 1995,
 the country looks for improvement in oil prices and will continue its
 policies of restraining public spending and encouraging non-oil
 exports.

@Senegal:Economy

 Overview: In 1994 Senegal embarked on its most concerted structural
 adjustment effort yet to exploit the 50% devaluation of the currencies
 of the 14 Francophone African nations on 12 January. After years of
 foot-dragging, the government finally passed a liberalized labor code
 which should significantly help lower the cost of labor and improve
 the manufacturing sector's competitiveness. Inroads also have been
 made in closing tax loopholes and eliminating monopoly power in
 several sectors. At the same time the government is holding the line
 on current fiscal expenditure under the watchful eyes of international
 organizations on which it depends for substantial support. A bumper
 peanut crop - Senegal's main source of foreign exchange - coincided
 with an improvement of international prices and probably resulted in a
 doubling of earnings in 1994 over 1993. The country's narrow resource
 base, environmental degradation, and untamed population growth will
 continue to hold back growth in living standards over the medium term.

@Serbia And Montenegro:Economy

 Overview: The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation in 1991 has
 been followed by bloody ethnic warfare, the destabilization of
 republic boundaries, and the breakup of important interrepublic trade
 flows. Serbia and Montenegro faces major economic problems; output has
 dropped sharply, particularly in 1993. First, like the other former
 Yugoslav republics, it depended on its sister republics for large
 amounts of foodstuffs, energy supplies, and manufactures. Wide
 differences in climate, mineral resources, and levels of technology
 among the republics accentuated this interdependence, as did the
 communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small
 number of giant plants. The breakup of many of the trade links, the
 sharp drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets,
 and the destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have
 contributed to the economic difficulties of the republics. One
 singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia and Montenegro is
 the continuation in office of a communist government that is primarily
 interested in political and military mastery, not economic reform. A
 further complication is the imposition of economic sanctions by the UN
 in 1992. Hyperinflation ended with the establishment of a new currency
 unit in June 1993; prices were relatively stable in 1994. Reliable
 statistics are hard to come by; the GDP estimate of $1,000 per capita
 in 1994 is extremely rough. Output in 1994 seems to have leveled off
 after the plunge in 1993.

 appliances), electronics, petroleum products, chemicals, and
 pharmaceuticals

 Agriculture: the fertile plains of Vojvodina produce 80% of the cereal
 production of the former Yugoslavia and most of the cotton, oilseeds,
 and chicory; Vojvodina also produces fodder crops to support intensive
 beef and dairy production; Serbia proper, although hilly, has a
 well-distributed rainfall and a long growing season; produces fruit,
 grapes, and cereals; in this area, livestock production (sheep and
 cattle) and dairy farming prosper; Kosovo produces fruits, vegetables,
 tobacco, and a small amount of cereals; the mountainous pastures of
 Kosovo and Montenegro support sheep and goat husbandry; Montenegro has
 only a small agriculture sector, mostly near the coast where a
 Mediterranean climate permits the culture of olives, citrus, grapes,
 and rice

@Seychelles:Economy

 Overview: Since independence in 1976, per capita output has grown to
 roughly seven times the old near-subsistence level, led by the tourist
 sector, which employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more
 than 70% of hard currency earnings. In recent years the government has
 encouraged foreign investment in order to upgrade hotels and other
 services. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the
 high dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming,
 fishing, and small-scale manufacturing. The vulnerability of the
 tourist sector was illustrated by the sharp drop in 1991-92 due
 largely to the Gulf war. Although the industry has rebounded, the
 government recognizes the continuing need for upgrading the sector in
 the face of stiff international competition.
