@Ethiopia, Economy

Overview: 
  With the independence of Eritrea on 27 April 1993, Ethiopia continues
  to face difficult economic problems as one of the poorest and least
  developed countries in Africa. (The accompanying analysis and figures
  predate the independence of Eritrea.) Its economy is based on
  subsistence agriculture, which accounts for about 45% of GDP, 90% of
  exports, and 80% of total employment; coffee generates 60% of export
  earnings. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs from
  the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but less
  than 10% of agriculture, is state run; the government is considering
  selling off a portion of state-owned plants. Favorable agricultural
  weather largely explains the 4.5% growth in output in FY89, whereas
  drought and deteriorating internal security conditions prevented
  growth in FY90. In 1991 the lack of law and order, particularly in the
  south, interfered with economic development and growth. In 1992,
  because of some easing of civil strife and aid from the outside world,
  the economy substantially improved.
National product:

@Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), Economy

Overview: 
  The economy is based on sheep farming, which directly or indirectly
  employs most of the work force. A few dairy herds are kept to meet
  domestic consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are
  primarily those for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments
  of high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins.
  Rich stocks of fish in the surrounding waters are not presently
  exploited by the islanders. So far, efforts to establish a domestic
  fishing industry have been unsuccessful. In 1987 the government began
  selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the
  Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license fees amount to more
  than $40 million per year and are a primary source of income for the
  government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development
  Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the
  abundant wildlife and trout fishing.

@Faroe Islands, Economy

Overview: 
  The Faroese, who have long enjoyed the affluent living standards of
  the Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the decline of
  the all-important fishing industry and one of the world's heaviest per
  capita external debts of nearly $30,000. When the nations of the world
  extended their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s,
  the Faroese no longer could continue their traditional long-distance
  fishing and subsequently depleted their own nearby fishing areas. The
  government's tight controls on fish stocks and its austerity measures
  have caused a recession, and subsidy cuts will force nationalization
  in the fishing industry, which has already been plagued with
  bankruptcies. Copenhagen has threatened to withhold its annual subsidy
  of $130 million - roughly one-third of the islands' budget revenues -
  unless the Faroese make significant efforts to balance their budget.
  To this extent the Faroe government is expected to continue its tough
  policies, including introducing a 20% value-added tax (VAT) in 1993,
  and has agreed to an IMF economic-political stabilization plan. In
  addition to its annual subsidy, the Danish government has bailed out
  the second largest Faroe bank to the tune of $140 million since
  October 1992.

@Fiji, Economy

Overview: 
  Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large subsistence
  sector. Sugar exports and tourism are the major sources of foreign
  exchange. Industry contributes 13% to GDP, with sugar processing
  accounting for one-third of industrial activity. Roughly 250,000
  tourists visit each year. Political uncertainty and drought, however,
  contribute to substantial fluctuations in earnings from tourism and
  sugar. In 1992, growth was approximately 3%, based on growth in
  tourism and a lessening of labor-management disputes in the sugar and
  gold-mining sectors. In 1993, the government's budgeted growth rate of
  3% was not achieved because of a decline in non-sugar agricultural
  output and damage from Cyclone Kina.

@Finland, Economy

Overview: 
  Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free market economy, with
  per capita output two-thirds of the US figure. Its key economic sector
  is manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, and engineering
  industries. Trade is important, with the export of goods representing
  about 30% of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland
  depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for
  manufactured goods. Because of the climate, agricultural development
  is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. The
  economy, which experienced an average of 4.9% annual growth between
  1987 and 1989, sank into deep recession in 1991 as growth contracted
  by 6.5%. The recession - which continued in 1992 with growth
  contracting by 4.1% - has been caused by economic overheating,
  depressed foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter system
  between Finland and the former Soviet Union under which Soviet oil and
  gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish
  Government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness
  and efficiency by an increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in
  public expenditures, partial privatization of state enterprises, and
  changes in monetary policy. In June 1991 Helsinki had tied the markka
  to the European Union's (EU) European Currency Unit (ECU) to promote
  stability. Ongoing speculation resulting from a lack of confidence in
  the government's policies forced Helsinki to devalue the markka by
  about 12% in November 1991 and to indefinitely break the link in
  September 1992. The devaluations have boosted the competitiveness of
  Finnish exports to the extent the recession bottomed out in 1993 with
  renewed economic growth expected in 1994. Unemployment probably will
  remain a serious problem during the next few years, with the majority
  of Finnish firms facing a weak domestic market and the troubled German
  and Swedish export markets. Declining revenues, increased transfer
  payments, and extensive funding to bail out the banking system pushed
  the central government's budget deficit to nearly 13% in 1993.
  Helsinki continues to harmonize its economic policies with those of
  the EU during Finland's current EU membership bid. In early 1995,
  Finland is expected to join the European Union (formerly the European
  Community), thus broadening European economic unity.

@France, Economy

Overview: 
  One of the world's most developed economies, France has substantial
  agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial
  sector. Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern
  technology, and subsidies have combined to make it the leading
  agricultural producer in Western Europe. Largely self-sufficient in
  agricultural products, France is a major exporter of wheat and dairy
  products. The industrial sector generates about one-quarter of GDP,
  and the growing services sector has become crucial to the economy.
  Although French GDP contracted by 0.7% in 1993, the economy showed
  signs of life by yearend. GDP growth, however, will remain sluggish in
  1994 - perhaps reaching only 1.0%. Rapidly increasing unemployment
  will still pose a major problem for the government. Paris remains
  committed to maintaining the franc-deutsche mark parity, which has
