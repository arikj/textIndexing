@Honduras:Economy

 Overview: Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western
 Hemisphere. Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy,
 accounts for 28% of GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and produces
 two-thirds of exports. Productivity remains low. Manufacturing, still
 in its early stages, employs 9% of the labor force, accounts for 15%
 of GDP, and generates 20% of exports. The service sectors, including
 public administration, account for 50% of GDP and employ 20% of the
 labor force. Many basic problems face the economy, including rapid
 population growth, high unemployment, inflation, a lack of basic
 services, a large and inefficient public sector, and the dependence of
 the export sector mostly on coffee and bananas, which are subject to
 sharp price fluctuations. A far-reaching reform program, initiated by
 former President CALLEJAS in 1990 and scaled back by President REINA,
 is beginning to take hold.

@Hong Kong:Economy

 Overview: Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few
 tariffs or nontariff barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food
 and raw materials must be imported. Manufacturing accounts for about
 17% of GDP. Goods and services exports account for about 50% of GDP.
 Real GDP growth averaged a remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in
 1989-90, and picked up to 4.2% in 1991, 5.0% in 1992, 5.2% in 1993,
 and 5.5% in 1994. Unemployment, which has been declining since the
 mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of labor continues to put
 upward pressure on prices and the cost of living. Prospects for
 1995-96 remain bright so long as major trading partners continue to be
 reasonably prosperous and so long as investors feel China will support
 free market practices after the takeover in 1997.

@Hungary:Economy

 Overview: Since 1989 Hungary has been a leader in the transition from
 a socialist command economy to a market economy - thanks in large part
 to its initial economic reforms during the Communist era. The private
 sector now accounts for about 55% of GDP. Nonetheless, the
 transformation is proving difficult, and many citizens say life was
 better under the old system. On the bright side, the four-year decline
 in output finally ended in 1994, as real GDP increased an estimated
 3%. This growth helped reduce unemployment to just over 10% by
 yearend, down from a peak of 13%. However, no progress was made
 against inflation, which remained stuck at about 20%, and the
 already-large current account deficit in the balance of payments
 actually got worse, reaching almost $4 billion. Underlying Hungary's
 other economic problems is the large budget deficit, which probably
 exceeded 7% of GDP in 1994, despite some late-year budget cutting by
 the new leftist government. In 1995 the government has pledged to
 accelerate privatization and lower the budget deficit to 5.5% of GDP.
 It believes this fiscal tightening will reduce the current account
 deficit to $2.5 billion but at the cost of holding economic growth to
 only 1%.

@Iceland:Economy

 Overview: Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically
 capitalistic, but with an extensive welfare system, relatively low
 unemployment, and comparatively even distribution of income. The
 economy is heavily dependent on the fishing industry, which provides
 nearly 75% of export earnings and employs 12% of the work force. In
 the absence of other natural resources - except energy - Iceland's
 economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. The economy, in
 recession since 1988, began to recover in 1993, posting 0.4% growth,
 but was still hampered by cutbacks in fish quotas as well as falling
 world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum,
 and ferrosilicon. Real GDP grew by perhaps 2.4% in 1994. The
 center-right government plans to continue its policies of reducing the
 budget and current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing,
 containing inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies,
 diversifying the economy, and privatizing state-owned industries. The
 government, however, remains divided on the issue of EU membership,
 primarily because of Icelanders' concern about losing control over
 their fishing resources.

@India:Economy

 Overview: India's economy is a mixture of traditional village farming,
 modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries,
 and a multitude of support services. Faster economic growth in the
 1980s permitted a significant increase in real per capita private
 consumption. A large share of the population, perhaps as much as 40%,
 remains too poor to afford an adequate diet. Financial strains in 1990
 and 1991 prompted government austerity measures that slowed industrial
 growth but permitted India to meet its international payment
 obligations without rescheduling its debt. Production, trade, and
 investment reforms since 1991 have provided new opportunities for
 Indian businessmen and an estimated 100 million to 200 million middle
 class consumers. New Delhi has always paid its foreign debts on
 schedule and has stimulated exports, attracted foreign investment, and
 revived confidence in India's economic prospects. Foreign exchange
 reserves, precariously low three years ago, now total more than $19
 billion. Positive factors for the remainder of the 1990s are India's
 strong entrepreneurial class and the central government's recognition
 of the continuing need for market-oriented approaches to economic
 development, for example in upgrading the wholly inadequate
 communications facilities. Negative factors include the desperate
 poverty of hundreds of millions of Indians and the impact of the huge
 and expanding population on an already overloaded environment.
