@Portugal, Economy

Overview: 
  Portugal's economy registered only 1.1% growth in 1992 and contracted
  by 0.4% in 1993, in contrast to the 4.5% average of the fast-paced
  1986-90 period. Recession in the European Union, which accounts for
  75% of Portugal's international trade, is the key factor in the
  downturn. The government's long-run economic goal is the modernization
  of Portuguese markets, industry, infrastructure, and workforce in
  order to catch up with productivity and income levels of the more
  advanced EU countries. Per capita income now equals only 55% of the EU
  average. The government's medium-term economic objective is to be in
  the first tier of EU countries eligible to join the economic and
  monetary union (EMU) as early as 1997. Economic policy in 1993 focused
  on reducing inflationary pressures by lowering the fiscal deficit,
  maintaining a stable escudo, moderating wage increases, and
  encouraging increased competition. Resumption of growth in the short
  run depends on the revival of growth in Europe as a whole, not a
  likely prospect in the immediate future.

@Puerto Rico, Economy

Overview: 
  Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean
  region. Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary sector of
  economic activity and income. Encouraged by duty free access to the US
  and by tax incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico
  since the 1950s. US minimum wage laws apply. Important industries
  include pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles, petrochemicals, and
  processed foods. Sugar production has lost out to dairy production and
  other livestock products as the main source of income in the
  agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important
  source of income for the island, with estimated arrivals of nearly 3
  million tourists in 1989. Unemployment remains a severe problem at
  18%.

@Reunion, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. Sugarcane has
  been the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it
  accounts for 85% of exports. The government has been pushing the
  development of a tourist industry to relieve high unemployment, which
  recently amounted to one-third of the labor force. The gap in Reunion
  between the well-off and the poor is extraordinary and accounts for
  the persistent social tensions. The white and Indian communities are
  substantially better off than other segments of the population, often
  approaching European standards, whereas indigenous groups suffer the
  poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the African
  continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991 illustrates
  the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic well-being of
  Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from France.

@Romania, Economy

Overview: 
  Despite the continuing difficulties in moving away from the former
  command system, the Romanian economy seems to have bottomed out in
  1993. Market oriented reforms have been introduced fitfully since the
  downfall of CEAUSESCU in December 1989, with the result a growing
  private sector, especially in services. The slow pace of structural
  reform, however, has exacerbated Romania's high inflation rate and
  eroded real wages. Agricultural production rebounded in 1993 from the
  previous year's drought-reduced harvest; food supplies are adequate,
  but expensive. Bucharest resisted pressure to devalue its currency
  despite a $638 million trade deficit in the first half of 1993 and the
  emergence of a black market for hard currency. Unable to support the
  currency, the national bank, nonetheless, was forced to depreciate the
  currency 65% over the course of the year. The return of winter
  revealed that much of Romania's infrastructure had deteriorated over
  the last four years due to reduced levels of public investment.
  Residents of the capital reported frequent disruptions of heating and
  water services.
