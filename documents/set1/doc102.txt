@Tuvalu, Economy

Overview: 
  Tuvalu consists of a scattered group of nine coral atolls with poor
  soil. The country has no known mineral resources and few exports.
  Subsistence farming and fishing are the primary economic activities.
  The islands are too small and too remote for development of a tourist
  industry. Government revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and
  coins and worker remittances. Substantial income is received annually
  from an international trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, NZ,
  and the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea.

@Uganda, Economy

Overview: 
  Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils,
  regular rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt.
  The economy has been devastated by widespread political instability,
  mismanagement, and civil war since independence in 1962. (GDP remains
  below the levels of the early 1970s, as does industrial production.)
  Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, employing
  over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export crop and
  accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government
  has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking
  currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing
  prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The
  policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation, which was
  running at over 300% in 1987, and boosting production and export
  earnings. In 1990-93, the economy has turned in a solid performance
  based on continued investment in the rehabilitation of infrastructure,
  improved incentives for production and exports, and gradually
  improving domestic security.

@Ukraine, Economy

Overview: 
  After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and away the most
  important economic component of the former Soviet Union producing more
  than three times the output of the next-ranking republic. Its fertile
  black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural
  output, and its farms provided substantial quantities of meat, milk,
  grain and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its diversified
  heavy industry supplied equipment and raw materials to industrial and
  mining sites in other regions of the former USSR. In 1992 the
  Ukrainian Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal
  framework for privatizing state enterprises while retaining many
  central economic controls and continuing subsidies to state production
  enterprises. In November 1992 the new Prime Minister KUCHMA launched a
  new economic reform program promising more freedom to the agricultural
  sector, faster privatization of small and medium enterprises, and
  stricter control over state subsidies. In 1993, however, severe
  internal political disputes over the scope and pace of economic reform
  and payment arrears on energy imports have led to further declines in
  output, and inflation of 50% or more per month by the last quarter. In
  first quarter 1994, national income and industrial output were less
  than two-thirds the first quarter 1993 figures, according to official
  statistics. At the same time an increasing number of people are
  developing small private businesses and exploiting opportunities in
  non-official markets. Even so, the magnitude of the problems and the
  slow pace in building new market-oriented institutions preclude a
  near-term recovery of output to the 1990 level. A vital economic
  concern in 1994 will continue to be Russia's decisions on the prices
  and quantities of oil and gas to be shipped to the Ukraine.
National product: 
  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $205.4 billion (1993 estimate from
  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and
  published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993; and as
  extrapolated to 1993 using official Ukrainian statistics, which are
  very uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)
National product real growth rate: 
  -16% (1993 est.)

  transshipment points for illicit drugs to Western Europe
Economic aid:

  atomic weapons from the US in 1994
Currency: 
  Ukraine withdrew the Russian ruble from circulation on 12 November
  1992 and declared the karbovanets (plural karbovantsi) sole legal
  tender in Ukrainian markets; Ukrainian officials claim this is an
  interim move toward introducing a new currency - the hryvnya -

@United Arab Emirates, Economy

Overview: 
  The UAE has an open economy with one of the world's highest incomes
  per capita and with a sizable annual trade surplus. Its wealth is
  based on oil and gas output (about 40% of GDP), and the fortunes of
  the economy fluctuate with the prices of those commodities. Since
  1973, the UAE has undergone a profound transformation from an
  impoverished region of small desert principalities to a modern state
  with a high standard of living. At present levels of production, crude
  oil reserves should last for over 100 years. Although much stronger
  economically than most Gulf states, the UAE faces similar problems
  with weak international oil prices and the pressures for cuts in OPEC
  oil production quotas. The UAE government is encouraging increased
  privatization within the economy.

@United Kingdom, Economy

Overview: 
  The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and financial
  centers, and its economy ranks among the four largest in Western
  Europe. The economy is essentially capitalistic; over the past
  thirteen years the ruling Tories have greatly reduced public ownership
  and contained the growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is
  intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards,
  producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor force. The
  UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves, and primary energy
  production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any
  industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and
  business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP
  while industry continues to decline in importance, now employing only
  25% of the work force and generating only 21% of GDP. The economy is
  emerging out of its 3-year recession with only weak recovery in 1993;
  even so, the economy fared better in 1993 than the economies of most
  other European countries. Unemployment is hovering around 10% of the
  labor force. The government in 1992 adopted a pro-growth strategy,
  cutting interest rates sharply and removing the pound from the
  European exchange rate mechanism. Excess industrial capacity probably
  will moderate inflation which for the first time in a decade is below
  the EC average. The major economic policy question for Britain in the
  1990s is the terms on which it participates in the financial and
  economic integration of Europe.
