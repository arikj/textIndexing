Economy

Economy - overview: Spain's mixed capitalist economy supports a GDP
three-fourths that of the four leading West European economies. Its
center-right government has staked much on gaining admission to the
first group of countries to implement the European single currency by
developing an austere 1997 budget - including a wage freeze for
public-sector employees - in hopes of meeting the Maastricht monetary
convergence criteria. The government slashed spending by $1.6 billion
in mid-1996 to ensure that Spain's deficit did not exceed its target
of 4.4% of GDP for the year; the government forecasts a deficit of 3%
for 1997. The AZNAR administration advocates liberalization,
privatization, and deregulation of the economy, and has introduced
some tax reforms to that end. Unemployment, nevertheless, remains the
highest in the EU at about 22%, but the government, for political
reasons, has made only limited progress in changing labor laws or
reforming pension schemes, which are key to the sustainability of
Spain's economic advances.

Economy

Economy - overview: Industry - dominated by the fast-growing apparel
industry - has surpassed agriculture as the main source of export
earnings. The economy has been plagued by high rates of unemployment
since the late 1970s. Economic growth accelerated in 1991-95 as
domestic conditions began to improve and conditions for foreign
investment brightened. In 1996, however, a drought, slow economic
reform, and civil war exacted a heavy economic toll. Insufficient
monsoon rains caused power cuts that hurt industrial and agricultural
production, and the stepped-up Tamil insurgency reduced foreign
investment and tourism - two key sources of foreign exchange.
Meanwhile, Colombo's counterinsurgency efforts caused defense
expenditures to overshoot budget targets by 42%. In 1997, agricultural
production should recover from the effects of last year's drought, but
industry will still be hampered by high real interest rates, slow
improvement in foreign investment inflows, and stalled progress on
privatization. The government's main challenge this year will be to
curb defense and social welfare spending to cut the budget deficit as
a percentage of GDP in half by 1998, as stipulated in its deficit
reduction program.

Economy

Economy - overview: Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political
instability, adverse weather, high inflation, a drop in remittances
from abroad, and counterproductive economic policies. The private
sector's main areas of activity are agriculture and trading, with most
private industrial investment predating 1980. Agriculture employs 80%
of the work force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items.
Sluggish economic performance over the past decade, attributable
largely to declining annual rainfall, has kept per capita income at
low levels. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages continue to cause
difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary Fund took the unusual
step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because of its nonpayment of
arrearages to the Fund. After Sudan backtracked on promised reforms in
1992-93, the IMF threatened to expel Sudan from the Fund. To avoid
expulsion, Khartoum agreed to make payments on its arrears to the
Fund, liberalize exchange rates, and reduce subsidies, measures it has
partially implemented. The government's continued prosecution of the
civil war and its growing international isolation continued to inhibit
growth in the nonagricultural sectors of the economy during 1996.
Hyperinflation has raised consumer prices above the reach of most.
Popular unrest erupted several times in 1996 in reaction to unpopular
government economic decisions.

Economy

Economy - overview: The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry,
which accounts for upwards of 15% of GDP and more than 65% of export
earnings. Following a dismal year in 1994 which saw the value of the
Surinamese currency plummet by about 80%, inflation rise to more than
600%, and national output fall for the fifth consecutive year, nearly
all economic indicators improved in 1995-96. The government unified
the exchange rate and maintained a fairly tight monetary policy.
Inflation apparently has been eliminated, and tax revenues have
increased sufficiently to erase the budget deficit. The release of
substantial development aid from the Netherlands - which had been held
up due to the government's failure to initiate economic reforms - also
has helped buoy the economy. Suriname's economic prospects for the
medium term will depend on continued implementation of economic
restructuring. The new government elected in the fall of 1996 has sent
mixed signals about commitment to these reforms.
