@Micronesia, Federated States Of:Economy

 Overview: Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming
 and fishing. The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting,
 except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry
 exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack of adequate
 facilities hinder development. Financial assistance from the US is the
 primary source of revenue, with the US pledged to spend $1 billion in
 the islands in the 1990s. Geographical isolation and a poorly
 developed infrastructure are major impediments to long-term growth.

@Moldova:Economy

 Overview: Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland but has
 no major mineral deposits. As a result, Moldova's economy is primarily
 based on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco.
 Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil, coal, and natural gas,
 and energy shortages have contributed to sharp production declines
 since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Moldovan government
 is making steady progress on an ambitious economic reform agenda, and
 the IMF has called Moldova a model for the region. As part of its
 reform efforts, Chisinau has introduced a stable currency, freed all
 prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises and
 backed their steady privatization, removed export controls, and freed
 interest rates. Chisinau appears strongly committed to continuing
 these reforms in 1995. Meanwhile, privatization of medium and large
 enterprises got underway in mid-1994 and is expected to pick up speed
 in 1995. To improve its precarious energy situation, Chisinau reached
 an agreement with Moscow in December 1994 on gas deliveries for 1995.
 Gazprom, Russia's national gas company, has agreed to reduce prices
 for natural gas deliveries to Moldova from the world market price of
 $80/thousand cubic meters (tcm) to $58/tcm in return for part
 ownership of the Moldovan pipeline system.

@Monaco:Economy

 Overview: Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast, is a
 popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant
 climate. The Principality has successfully sought to diversify into
 services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The
 state has no income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax
 haven both for individuals who have established residence and for
 foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices. About 50%
 of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels,
 banks, and the industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from
 tourism. Living standards are high, that is, roughly comparable to
 those in prosperous French metropolitan suburbs.

@Mongolia:Economy

 Overview: Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population, and wide
 expanses of unproductive land have constrained economic development.
 Economic activity traditionally has been based on agriculture and the
 breeding of livestock. In past years extensive mineral resources had
 been developed with Soviet support; total Soviet assistance at its
 height amounted to 30% of GDP. The mining and processing of coal,
 copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold account for a large part
 of industrial production. Timber and fishing are also important
 sectors. The Mongolian leadership has been gradually making the
 transition from Soviet-style central planning to a market economy
 through privatization and price reform, and is soliciting support from
 international financial agencies and foreign investors. The economy,
 however, has still not recovered from the loss of Soviet aid, and the
 country continues to suffer substantial economic hardships, with
 one-fourth of the population below the poverty line.

@Morocco:Economy

 Overview: Morocco faces the typical problems of developing countries -
 restraining government spending, reducing constraints on private
 activity and foreign trade, and keeping inflation within bounds. Since
 the early 1980s the government has pursued an economic program toward
 these objectives with the support of the IMF, the World Bank, and the
 Paris Club of creditors. The economy has substantial assets to draw
 on: the world's largest phosphate reserves, diverse agricultural and
 fishing resources, a sizable tourist industry, a growing manufacturing
 sector, and remittances from Moroccans working abroad. A severe
 drought in 1992-93 depressed economic activity and held down exports.
 Real GDP contracted by 4.4% in 1992 and 1.1% in 1993. Despite these
 setbacks, initiatives to relax capital controls, strengthen the
 banking sector, and privatize state enterprises went forward in
 1993-94. Favorable rainfall in 1994 boosted agricultural production by
 40%. Servicing the large debt, high unemployment, and vulnerability to
 external economic forces remain long-term problems for Morocco.
