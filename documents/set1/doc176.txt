Economy

Economy - overview: Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with
few tariffs or nontariff barriers. Natural resources are limited, and
food and raw materials must be imported. Manufacturing and
construction account for about 18% of GDP. Goods and services exports
account for about 50% of GDP. Real GDP growth averaged a remarkable 8%
in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90, and picked up to 4.2% in 1991,
5.0% in 1992, 5.2% in 1993, 5.5% in 1994, 4.8% in 1995, and 4.7% in
1996. A shortage of labor continues to put upward pressure on prices
and the cost of living. Prospects for 1997 remain bright so long as
major trading partners continue to be reasonably prosperous and so
long as investors feel China will support free market practices after
the takeover on 1 July 1997.

Economy

Economy - overview: Hungary probably had the most Western-oriented
economy in East Europe before the transition to a market system began
in 1990, and Budapest made good progress in the initial years of
transition. The reform process slowed in 1993-94, however, in part
because of the May 1994 elections and the resulting change in
government. By 1994 the privatization of state firms had ground to a
halt, while both the budget and current account deficits soared to
unsustainable levels - about 8% and 10% of GDP, respectively. The
situation improved sharply in 1995: an austerity program introduced in
March reduced both deficits; and a renewed privatization effort later
in the year resulted in more than $3 billion worth of sales of state
firms to foreign investors - money used mostly to reduce Hungary's
large foreign debt. Real GDP increased 2.9% in 1994 - following
several years of steep decline - and about 1.5% in 1995 and only 0.5%
in 1996. Unemployment reached 14% in early 1993 before gradually
falling back to 11% in 1996. Inflation has oscillated; it reached 40%
in mid-1991, dropped to 17% in early 1994, jumped back to 31% by
mid-1995, and settled at 20% in 1996. Prospects for 1997 and 1998 are
good compared with the situation earlier. Most forecasters expect 2%
to 3% GDP growth in 1997 and slightly higher growth in 1998. Inflation
and unemployment are edging down. With the government still committed
to reform, both the budget and current account deficits are at IMF
target levels - about 4% of GDP. Budapest also is making good progress
in restructuring the pension, health, tax, education, and other
systems as part of the effort to decrease the role of government. This
dramatic shift in economic policy was rewarded in 1996 by the IMF,
which finally signed the standby agreement Budapest had sought, and by
the OECD, which welcomed Hungary as a member.

Economy

Economy - overview: Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically
capitalistic, yet with an extensive welfare system, low unemployment,
and remarkably even distribution of income. The economy depends
heavily on the fishing industry, which provides 75% of export earnings
and employs 12% of the work force. In the absence of other natural
resources - except energy - Iceland's economy is vulnerable to
changing world fish prices. The economy remains sensitive to declining
fish stocks as well as to drops in world prices for its main exports:
fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. The center-right
government plans to continue its policies of reducing the budget and
current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing
inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying
the economy, and privatizing state-owned industries. The government
remains opposed to EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders'
concern about losing control over their fishing resources.
