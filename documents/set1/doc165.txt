Economy

Economy - overview: Because of its offshore oil resources and
favorable agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the
best-endowed primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still,
it faces many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped
countries, such as political instability, a top-heavy civil service,
and a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. The
development of the oil sector led to rapid economic growth between
1970 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986, precipitated by
steep declines in the prices of major exports: coffee, cocoa, and
petroleum. Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and
inefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed. Since 1990, the
government has embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs
designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in
agriculture, improve trade and recapitalize the nation's banks.
Political instability, following suspect elections in 1992, has
limited the effectiveness of aid programs. Currently, Cameroon
receives only minimal assistance from the IMF and the World Bank.
Although the 50% devaluation of the currency of 12 January 1994
improved the potential for export growth, mismanagement remains and is
the main barrier to economic improvement. The devaluation led to a
spurt in inflation to 48% in 1994, but it moderated in 1995-96.
Progress toward privatization of remaining state industry remains
slow.

Economy

Economy - overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society,
Canada today closely resembles the US in per capita output,
market-oriented economic system, and pattern of production. Since
World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and
service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
economy into one primarily industrial and urban. Canada started the
1990s in recession, and real rates of growth have averaged only 1.1%
so far this decade. Because of slower growth, Canada still faces high
unemployment - especially in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces - and a
large public sector debt. With its great natural resources, skilled
labor force, and modern capital plant, however, Canada will enjoy
better economic prospects in the future. The continuing constitutional
impasse between English- and French-speaking areas is raising the
possibility of a split in the confederation, making foreign investors
somewhat edgy.

Economy

Economy - overview: Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor
natural resource base, serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles
of long-term drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service
oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for
almost 70% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in
rural areas, the share of agriculture in GNP is only 14%, of which
fishing accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The
fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited.
Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances
from emigrants and foreign aid, which form important supplements to
GDP. Economic reforms, launched by the new democratic government in
1991, are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting
foreign investment to diversify the economy. Prospects for 1997 depend
heavily on the maintenance of aid flows, remittances, and the momentum
of the government's development program.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

Introduction

Current issues: in 1996 the Central African Republic experienced three
mutinies by dissident elements of the armed forces which demanded back
pay as well as political and military reforms; continuing violence in
1997 between the government and rebel military and civilian groups
over pay issues, living conditions, and lack of opposition party
representation in the government has destroyed many businesses in the
capital, reducing tax revenues and exacerbating the government's
problems in meeting expenses

Economy

Economy - overview: Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry,
remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic
(CAR), with more than 70% of the population living in outlying areas.
The agricultural sector generates half of GDP. Timber has accounted
for about 16% of export earnings and the diamond industry for nearly
54%. Important constraints to economic development include the CAR's
landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled
work force, and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies. The
50% devaluation of the currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on
12 January 1994 had mixed effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond,
timber, coffee, and cotton exports increased, leading an estimated
rise of GDP of 7% in 1994 and nearly 5% in 1995. Inflation, however,
remains a problem. Moreover, ongoing violence between the government
and rebel military and civilian groups over pay issues, living
conditions, and opposition party political representation has
destroyed many businesses in the capital, reducing tax revenues for
the government, and delaying negotiations for an IMF financial aid
agreement.

CHAD

Introduction

Historical perspective: After enduring decades of civil warfare among
ethnic groups as well as invasions by Libya, Chad got started toward a
more stable state with the seizure of the government in early December
1990 by former northern guerrilla leader Idress DEBY. His transitional
government eventually suppressed armed rebellion in all quarters of
the country, settled the territorial dispute with Libya on terms
favorable to Chad, produced a democratic constitution which was
ratified by popular referendum in March 1996, held multiparty national
presidential elections in June and July 1996 (DEBY won with 67% of the
vote), and held multiparty elections to the National Assembly in
January and February 1997, in which Idress DEBY's party, Patriotic
Salvation Movement or MPS, won a majority of the seats.
