@South Africa, Economy

Overview: 
  Many of the white one-seventh of the South African population enjoy
  incomes, material comforts, and health and educational standards equal
  to those of Western Europe. In contrast, most of the remaining
  population suffers from the poverty patterns of the Third World,
  including unemployment and lack of job skills. The main strength of
  the economy lies in its rich mineral resources, which provide
  two-thirds of exports. Economic developments for the remainder of the
  1990s will be driven largely by the new government's attempts to
  improve black living conditions and to set the country on an
  aggressive export-led growth path. The shrinking economy in recent
  years has absorbed less than 5% of the more than 300,000 workers
  entering the labor force annually. Local economists estimate that the
  economy must grow between 5% and 6% in real terms annually to absorb
  all of the new entrants.

@Spain, Economy

Overview: 
  After the economic boom of 1986-90, the Spanish economy fell into
  recession along with the economies of other EU member states. Real GDP
  barely grew in 1992 and declined by approximately 1% in 1993.
  Unemployment, now nearly one-fourth of the workforce, and the sharp
  downturn in business investment have contributed to sagging domestic
  demand. Devaluation of the peseta since September 1992 has made
  Spanish exports more competitive, but an export-led recovery in 1994
  will depend largely on economic recovery in Spain's major market - the
  other EU nations. A solid recovery will also require appropriate
  domestic policy actions, including controlling the budget deficit and
  wage increases, reforming labor market regulations, and possibly
  loosening monetary policy another notch. Foreign investors,
  principally from other EU countries, have invested over $60 billion in
  Spain since 1986. Despite the recession, inflation remained at about
  5% in 1993. The main source of inflationary pressure is the fiscal
  deficit.

@Sudan, Economy

Overview: 
  Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political instability, adverse
  weather, high inflation, a drop in remittances from abroad, and
  counterproductive economic policies. The economy is dominated by
  governmental entities that account for more than 70% of new
  investment. The private sector's main areas of activity are
  agriculture and trading, with most private industrial investment
  predating 1980. The economy's base is agriculture, which employs 80%
  of the work force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items.
  Sluggish economic performance over the past decade, attributable
  largely to declining annual rainfall, has reduced levels of per capita
  income and consumption. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages
  continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary
  Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because
  of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund. The government
  implemented a comprehensive economic reform program in 1992 that
  included slashing the fiscal deficit, liberalizing foreign exchange
  regulations, and lifting most price controls, but it had backtracked
  on most reforms by mid-1993 because of its fear of generating a
  domestic backlash. The government's failure to pursue economic reform,
  its continued prosecution of the civil war, and its growing
  international isolation have led to a further deterioration of the
  non-agricultural sectors of the economy during 1993. Agriculture, on
  the other hand, after several disappointing years, enjoyed favorable
  growing conditions in 1993, and its strong performance produced an
  overall growth rate in GNP of about 7%.

@Suriname, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry, which accounts for
  15% of GDP and about 70% of export earnings. The economy has been in
  trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in 1982. A drop in world
  bauxite prices which started in the late 1970s and continued until
  late 1986 was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla insurgency in
  the interior that crippled the important bauxite sector. Although the
  insurgency has since ebbed and the bauxite sector recovered,
  Paramaribo has failed to initiate the economic reforms necessary to
  stabilize the economy or win renewed Dutch aid disbursements. High
  inflation, high unemployment, widespread black market activity, and
  hard currency shortfalls continue to mark the economy.
