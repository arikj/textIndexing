@Cyprus, Economy

Overview: 
  The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and prosperous.
  Industry contributes 16% to GDP and employs 29% of the labor force,
  while the service sector contributes 60% to GDP and employs 57% of the
  labor force. An average 6.8% rise in real GDP between 1986 and 1990
  was temporarily checked in 1991, because of the adverse effects of the
  Gulf War on tourism. Economic growth surged again in 1992, bolstered
  by strong foreign and domestic demand. As the economy gained momentum,
  however, it began to overheat; inflation reached 6.5%. The economy has
  likely recorded a sharp drop in growth in 1993, due to the recession
  in Western Europe, Cyprus' main trading partner, but probably will
  pick up again in 1994. The Turkish Cypriot economy has less than
  one-third the per capita GDP in the south. Because it is recognized
  only by Turkey, it has had much difficulty arranging foreign
  financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to invest there. The
  economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture, which employs more
  than one-quarter of the workforce. Moreover, because the Turkish lira
  is legal tender, the Turkish Cypriot economy has suffered the same
  high inflation as mainland Turkey. To compensate for the economy's
  weakness, Turkey provides direct and indirect aid to nearly every
  sector; financial support has reached about one-third of Turkish
  Cypriot GDP.

@Czech Republic, Economy

Overview: 
  The dissolution of Czechoslovakia into two independent nation states -
  the Czech Republic and Slovakia - on 1 January 1993 has complicated
  the task of moving toward a more open and decentralized economy. The
  old Czechoslovakia, even though highly industrialized by East European
  standards, suffered from an aging capital plant, lagging technology,
  and a deficiency in energy and many raw materials. In January 1991,
  approximately one year after the end of communist control of Eastern
  Europe, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic launched a sweeping
  program to convert its almost entirely state-owned and controlled
  economy to a market system. In 1991-92 these measures resulted in
  privatization of some medium- and small-scale economic activity and
  the setting of more than 90% of prices by the market - but at a cost
  in inflation, unemployment, and lower output. For Czechoslovakia as a
  whole inflation in 1991 was roughly 50% and output fell 15%. In 1992,
  in the Czech lands, inflation dropped to an estimated 12.5% and GDP
  was down a more moderate 5%. In 1993, Czech aggregate output remained
  unchanged, prices rose about 19%, and unemployment hovered above 3%;
  exports to Slovakia fell roughly 30%. An estimated 40% of the economy
  was privately owned. In 1994, Prague expects 2% to 3% growth in GDP,
  roughly 9% inflation, and 5% unemployment. Economic growth in 1994 is
  less important than continued economic restructuring; a mere 1% growth
  would be noteworthy if restructuring is accompanied by rising
  unemployment and enterprise bankruptcies.

@Denmark, Economy

Overview: 
  This modern economy features high-tech agriculture, up-to-date
  small-scale and corporate industry, extensive government welfare
  measures, comfortable living standards, and high dependence on foreign
  trade. Denmark's new center-left coalition government will concentrate
  on reducing the persistent high unemployment rate and the budget
  deficit as well as following the previous government's policies of
  maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. In the face
  of recent international market pressure on the Danish krone, the
  coalition has also vowed to maintain a stable currency. The coalition
  hopes to lower marginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax
  revenues; boost industrial competitiveness through labor market and
  tax reforms and increased research and development funds; and improve
  welfare services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays.
  Prime Minister RASMUSSEN's reforms will focus on adapting Denmark to
  the criteria for European integration by 1999; although Copenhagen has
  won from the European Union (EU) the right to opt out of the European
  Monetary Union (EMU) if a national referendum rejects it. Denmark is,
  in fact, one of the few EU countries likely to fit into the EMU on
  time. Denmark is weathering the current worldwide slump better than
  many West European countries. As the EU's single market (formally
  established on 1 January 1993) gets underway, Danish economic growth
  is expected to pickup to around 2% in 1994. Danish approval of the
  Maastricht treaty on EU political and economic union in May 1993 has
  reversed the drop in investment, further boosting growth. The current
  account surplus remains strong as limitations on wage increases and
  low inflation - expected to be around 2% in 1994 - improve export
  competitiveness. Although unemployment is high, it remains stable
  compared to most European countries.

@Djibouti, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy is based on service activities connected with the
  country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in
  northeast Africa. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port
  for the region and an international transshipment and refueling
  center. It has few natural resources and little industry. The nation
  is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance (an important
  supplement to GDP) to help support its balance of payments and to
  finance development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30%
  continues to be a major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an
  estimated 35% over the last five years because of recession, civil
  war, and a high population growth rate (including immigrants and
  refugees).
National product: 
  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $500 million (1993 est.)

@Dominican Republic, Economy

Overview: 
  Rapid growth of free trade zones has led to a substantial expansion of
  manufacturing for export, especially of wearing apparel. Over the past
  decade, tourism has also increased in importance and is a major earner
  of foreign exchange and a source of new jobs. Agriculture remains a
  key sector of the economy. The principal commercial crop is sugarcane,
  followed by coffee, cotton, cocoa, and tobacco. Domestic industry is
  based on the processing of agricultural products, oil refining,
  minerals, and chemicals. Unemployment is officially reported at about
  30%, but there is considerable underemployment. Growth fell to a
  moderate 3% in 1993 because of power shortages in industry and
  political uncertainty which slowed down foreign investment.
