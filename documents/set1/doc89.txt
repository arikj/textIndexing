@Monaco, Economy

Overview: 
  Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast, is a popular
  resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate. The
  Principality has successfully sought to diversify into services and
  small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The state has no
  income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for
  individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies
  that have set up businesses and offices. About 50% of Monaco's annual
  revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels, banks, and the
  industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from tourism. Living
  standards are high, that is, roughly comparable to those in prosperous
  French metropolitan suburbs.

@Mongolia, Economy

Overview: 
  Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population, and wide expanses of
  unproductive land have constrained economic development. Economic
  activity traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding
  of livestock - Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person
  in the world. In past years extensive mineral resources had been
  developed with Soviet support; total Soviet assistance at its height
  amounted to 30% of GDP. The mining and processing of coal, copper,
  molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold account for a large part of
  industrial production. Timber and fishing are also important sectors.
  The Mongolian leadership is trying to make the transition from
  Soviet-style central planning to a market economy through
  privatization and price reform, and is soliciting support from
  international financial agencies and foreign investors. The economy,
  however, has still not recovered from the loss of Soviet aid, and the
  country continues to suffer substantial economic hardships.

@Morocco, Economy

Overview: 
  Morocco faces the typical problems of developing
  countries--restraining government spending, reducing constraints on
  private activity and foreign trade, and keeping inflation within
  bounds. Since the early 1980s the government has pursued an economic
  program toward these objectives with the support of the IMF, the World
  Bank, and the Paris Club of creditors. The economy has substantial
  assets to draw on: the world's largest phosphate reserves, diverse
  agricultural and fishing resources, a sizable tourist industry, a
  growing manufacturing sector, and large remittances from Moroccans
  working abroad. However, a severe drought in 1992-93 has depressed
  economic activity and held down experts. Real GDP contracted by 2.9%
  in 1992, and growth for 1993 is estimated at only 2%. Despite these
  setbacks, initiatives to relax capital controls, strengthen the
  banking sector, and privatize state enterprises went forward in 1993.
  Servicing the large debt, high unemployment, and vulnerability to
  external economic forces remain long-term problems for Morocco.

@Mozambique, Economy

Overview: 
  One of Africa's poorest countries, Mozambique has failed to exploit
  the economic potential of its sizable agricultural, hydropower, and
  transportation resources. Indeed, national output, consumption, and
  investment declined throughout the first half of the 1980s because of
  internal disorders, lack of government administrative control, and a
  growing foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid, attracted by an
  economic reform policy, resulted in successive years of economic
  growth in the late 1980s, but aid has declined steadily since 1989.
  Agricultural output is at only 75% of its 1981 level, and grain has to
  be imported. Industry operates at only 20-40% of capacity. The economy
  depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat. Peace accords
  signed in October 1992 improved chances of foreign investment, aided
  IMF-supported economic reforms, and supported continued economic
  recovery.

@Namibia, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy is heavily dependent on the mining industry to extract and
  process minerals for export. Mining accounts for almost 25% of GDP.
  Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa
  and the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial diamond
  deposits are among the richest in the world, making Namibia a primary
  source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large
  quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver, and tungsten. More than half
  the population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence
  agriculture) for its livelihood.
