@Norway, Economy

Overview: 
  Norway has a mixed economy involving a combination of free market
  activity and government intervention. The government controls key
  areas, such as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state
  enterprises) and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and
  areas with sparse resources. Norway also maintains an extensive
  welfare system that helps propel public sector expenditures to
  slightly more than 50% of the GDP and results in one of the highest
  average tax burdens in the world (54%). A small country with a high
  dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an exporter of
  raw materials and semiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small- and
  medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations.
  The country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum,
  hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on
  its oil sector to keep its economy afloat. Although one of the
  government's main priorities is to reduce this dependency, this
  situation is not likely to improve for years to come. The government
  also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and diversify the
  economy through tax reform and a series of expansionary budgets. The
  budget deficit is expected to hit a record 8% of GDP because of
  welfare spending and bail-outs of the banking system. Unemployment
  continues at record levels of over 10% - including those in job
  programs - because of the weakness of the economy outside the oil
  sector. Economic growth was only 1.6% in 1993, while inflation was a
  moderate 2.3%. Oslo, a member of the European Free Trade Area, has
  applied for membership in the European Union and continues to
  deregulate and harmonize with EU regulations. Membership is expected
  in early 1995.

@Oman, Economy

Overview: 
  Economic performance is closely tied to the fortunes of the oil
  industry, including trends in international oil prices and the ability
  of OPEC producers to agree on output quotas. Petroleum accounts for
  more than 85% of export earnings, about 80% of government revenues,
  and roughly 40% of GDP. Oman has proved oil reserves of 4 billion
  barrels, equivalent to about 20 years' supply at the current rate of
  extraction. Agriculture is carried on at a subsistence level and the
  general population depends on imported food. The government is
  encouraging private investment, both domestic and foreign, as a prime
  force for further economic development.

  Tourism provides some foreign exchange, although the remote location
  of Palau and a shortage of suitable facilities has hindered
  development. The government is the major employer of the work force,

total area: 
  165.384 million sq km 
comparative area: 
  about 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean (followed by the
  Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean); covers about
  one-third of the global surface; larger than the total land area of
  the world
note: 
  includes Bali Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering Sea, Bering Strait,
  Coral Sea, East China Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of Tonkin, Java Sea,
  Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Savu Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk,
  South China Sea, Tasman Sea, Timor Sea, and other tributary water
  bodies
Coastline: 
  135,663 km 
International disputes: 
  some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
Climate: 
  the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy season occurs during the
  summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the
  land, and a dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow
  from the Asian land mass back to the ocean
Terrain: 
  surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a clockwise,
  warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in the
  southern Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the
  northern Pacific sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk in
  winter; in the southern Pacific sea ice from Antarctica reaches its
  northernmost extent in October; the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific
  is dominated by the East Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is
  dissected by deep trenches, including the world's deepest, the 10,924
  meter Marianas Trench
Natural resources: 
  oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates,
  placer deposits, fish 
Environment: 
current issues: 
  endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion, sea otter,
  seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine Sea and South
  China Sea
natural hazards: 
  surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and earthquake activity
  sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire; subject to tropical
  cyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east Asia from May to December
  (most frequent from July to October); tropical cyclones (hurricanes)
  may form south of Mexico and strike Central America and Mexico from
  June to October (most common in August and September); southern
  shipping lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica; occasional El Nino
  phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade winds slacken
  and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent moves south, killing the
  plankton that is the primary food source for anchovies; consequently,
  the anchovies move to better feeding grounds, causing resident marine
  birds to starve by the thousands because of their lost food source
international agreements: 
  NA 
Note: 
  the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal, Luzon
  Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific
  Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; ships
  subject to superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May
  and in extreme south from May to October; persistent fog in the
  northern Pacific from June to December is a hazard to shipping; dotted
  with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in the southwestern

@Pacific Ocean, Economy

Overview: 
  The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and
  particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides
  low-cost sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing
  grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel
  for the construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's
  fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where
  the fish catch has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of
  offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in
  the energy supplies of Australia, NZ, China, US, and Peru. The high
  cost of recovering offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings
  in world prices for oil since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new
  drillings.
Industries: 
  fishing, oil and gas production

@Pakistan, Economy

Overview: 
  Pakistan is a poor Third World country faced with the usual problems
  of rapidly increasing population, sizable government deficits, and
  heavy dependence on foreign aid. In addition, the economy must support
  a large military establishment. Rapid economic growth, averaging 5%-6%
  over the past decade has helped Pakistan cope with these problems.
  However, growth slumped to 3% in FY93 because of severe flooding,
  which damaged the key export crop, cotton. Almost all agriculture and
  small-scale industry is in private hands. In 1990, Pakistan embarked
  on a sweeping economic liberalization program to boost foreign and
  domestic private investment and lower foreign aid dependence. The
  SHARIF government denationalized several state-owned firms and
  attracted some foreign investment. Pakistan likely will have
  difficulty raising living standards because of its rapidly expanding
  population. At the current rate of growth, population would double in
  25 years.

@Panama, Economy

Overview: 
  GDP expanded by roughly 5.9% in 1993, following growth of 8% in 1992;
  banking and financial services led the way in 1993. The economy thus
  continues to recover from the crisis that preceded the ouster of
  Manuel NORIEGA, even though the government's structural adjustment
  program has been hampered by a lack of popular support and a passive
  administration. Public investment has been limited as the
  administration has kept the fiscal deficit below 2% of GDP.
