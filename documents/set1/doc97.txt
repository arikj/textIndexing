@Sierra Leone, Economy

Overview: 
  The economic and social infrastructure is not well developed.
  Subsistence agriculture dominates the economy, generating about
  one-third of GDP and employing about two-thirds of the working
  population. Manufacturing, which accounts for roughly 10% of GDP,
  consists mainly of the processing of raw materials and of light
  manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining provides an
  important source of hard currency. In 1990-93, the government, with
  the support of the IMF and the World Bank, has made substantial
  progress toward structural reform and better fiscal management. The
  government readily met all IMF/WB targets in December 1993. The budget
  deficit had been dramatically reduced; the government workforce had
  been cut by 25%; large amounts of domestic debt had been retired;
  arrears to the IMF, World Bank, and other creditors had been reduced.
  On the negative side, continued incursions by the Liberian rebels,
  bandits, and army deserters in southern and eastern Sierra Leone have
  severely strained the economy and threaten economically critical
  regions of the country.

@Singapore, Economy

Overview: 
  Singapore has an open entrepreneurial economy with strong service and
  manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading links
  derived from its entrepot history. The economy registered nearly 10%
  growth in 1993 while stemming inflation. The construction and
  financial services industries and manufacturers of computer-related
  components have led economic growth. Rising labor costs continue to be
  a threat to Singapore's competitiveness, but there are indications
  that productivity is keeping up. In applied technology, per capita
  output, investment, and labor discipline, Singapore has key attributes
  of a developed country.

@Slovakia, Economy

Overview: 
  The dissolution of Czechoslovakia into two independent states - the
  Czech Republic and Slovakia - on 1 January 1993 has complicated the
  task of moving toward a more open and decentralized economy. The old
  Czechoslovakia, even though highly industrialized by East European
  standards, suffered from an aging capital plant, lagging technology,
  and a deficiency in energy and many raw materials. In January 1991,
  approximately one year after the end of communist control of Eastern
  Europe, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic launched a sweeping
  program to convert its almost entirely state-owned and controlled
  economy to a market system. In 1991-92 these measures resulted in
  privatization of some medium- and small-scale economic activity and
  the setting of more than 90% of prices by the market - but at a cost
  in inflation, unemployment, and lower output. For Czechoslovakia as a
  whole inflation in 1991 was roughly 50% and output fell 15%. In 1992
  in Slovakia, inflation slowed to an estimated 8.7% and the estimated
  fall in GDP was a more moderate 7%. In 1993 GDP fell roughly 5%, with
  the disruptions from the separation from the Czech lands probably
  accounting for half the decline; exports to the Czech Republic fell
  about 35%. Bratislava adopted an austerity program in June and
  devalued its currency 10% in July. In 1993, inflation rose an
  estimated 23%, unemployment topped 14%, and the budget deficit
  exceeded the IMF target of $485 million by over $200 million. By
  yearend 1993 Bratislava estimated that 29% of GDP was being produced
  in the private sector. The forecast for 1994 is gloomy; Bratislava
  optimistically projects no growth in GDP, 17% unemployment, a $425
  million budget deficit, and 12% inflation. At best, if Slovakia stays
  on track with the IMF, GDP could fall by only 2-3% in 1994 and
  unemployment could be held under 18%, but a currency devaluation will
  likely drive inflation above 15%.

@Slovenia, Economy

Overview: 
  Slovenia was by far the most prosperous of the former Yugoslav
  republics, with a per capita income more than twice the Yugoslav
  average, indeed not far below the levels in neighboring Austria and
  Italy. Because of its strong ties to Western Europe and the small
  scale of damage during its brief fight for independence from
  Yugoslavia, Slovenia has the brightest prospects among the former
  Yugoslav republics for economic recovery over the next few years. The
  dissolution of Yugoslavia, however, has led to severe short-term
  dislocations in production, employment, and trade ties. For example,
  overall industrial production has fallen 26% since 1990; particularly
  hard hit have been the iron and steel, machine-building, chemical, and
  textile industries. Meanwhile, the continued fighting in other former
  Yugoslav republics has led to further destruction of long-established
  trade channels and to an influx of tens of thousands of Croatian and
  Bosnian refugees. The key program for breaking up and privatizing
  major industrial firms was established in late 1992. Despite slow
  progress in privatization Slovenia has reasonable prospects for an
  upturn in 1994. Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are
  Slovenia's comparatively well-educated work force, its developed
  infrastructure, and its Western business attitudes, but instability in
  Croatia is a deterrent. Slovenia in absolute terms is a small economy,
  and a little Western investment would go a long way.

@Somalia, Economy

Overview: 
  One of the world's poorest and least developed countries, Somalia has
  few resources. Moreover, much of the economy has been devastated by
  the civil war. Agriculture is the most important sector, with
  livestock accounting for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export
  earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for
  their livelihoods make up more than half of the population. Crop
  production generates only 10% of GDP and employs about 20% of the work
  force. The main export crop is bananas; sugar, sorghum, and corn are
  grown for the domestic market. The small industrial sector is based on
  the processing of agricultural products and accounts for less than 10%
  of GDP. Greatly increased political turmoil in 1991-93 has resulted in
  a substantial drop in output, with widespread famine.
