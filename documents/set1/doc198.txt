Economy

Economy - overview: Tajikistan had the next-to-lowest per capita GDP
in the former USSR, the highest rate of population growth, an
extremely low standard of living, and rampant inflation. Agriculture
dominates the economy, with cotton being the most important crop.
Mineral resources, varied but limited in amount, include silver, gold,
uranium, and tungsten. Industry is limited to a large aluminum plant,
hydropower facilities, and small obsolete factories mostly in light
industry and food processing. The Tajik economy has been gravely
weakened by four years of civil conflict and by the loss of subsidies
from Moscow and of markets for its products, which has left Tajikistan
dependent on Russia and Uzbekistan and on international humanitarian
assistance for much of its basic subsistence needs. Moreover, constant
political turmoil and the continued dominance by former communist
officials have impeded the introduction of meaningful economic
reforms. The regime made initial efforts to stabilize the economy and
promote reform in 1996.

Economy

Economy - overview: Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the
world. The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts
for 57% of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work
force. Topography and climatic conditions, however, limit cultivated
crops to only 4% of the land area. Industry accounts for 17% of GDP
and is mainly limited to processing agricultural products and light
consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced in mid-1986
has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided
funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure.
Growth in 1991-96 has featured a pickup in industrial production and a
substantial increase in output of minerals, led by gold. Recent
banking reforms have helped increase private sector growth and
investment.

Economy

Economy - overview: One of the more advanced developing countries in
Asia, Thailand depends on exports of manufactures - including
high-technology goods - and the development of the service sector to
fuel the country's rapid growth, averaging 9% since 1989. Most of
Thailand's recent imports have been for capital equipment and raw
materials, although imports of consumer goods are beginning to rise.
Thailand's 35% domestic savings rate is a key source of capital for
the economy, and the country is also benefiting from rising investment
from abroad. Prime Minister CHAWALIT's government - Thailand's seventh
government in six years - will continue Bangkok's probusiness policies
and reemphasize Bangkok's traditional fiscal austerity. CHAWALIT is
beginning to address Thailand's serious infrastructure bottlenecks,
especially in the transport and telecommunications sectors. Over the
longer term, Bangkok must produce more college graduates with
technical training and upgrade workers' skills to continue its rapid
economic development.

Economy

Economy - overview: This small sub-Saharan economy is heavily
dependent on both commercial and subsistence agriculture, which
provides employment for more than 60% of the labor force. Cocoa,
coffee, and cotton together generate about 30% of export earnings.
Togo is self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal.
In the industrial sector, phosphate mining is by far the most
important activity, although it has suffered from the collapse of
world phosphate prices and increased foreign competition. Togo serves
as a regional commercial and trade center. The government's
decade-long effort, supported by the World Bank and the IMF, to
implement economic reform measures, encourage foreign investment, and
bring revenues in line with expenditures has stalled. Political
unrest, including private and public sector strikes throughout 1992
and 1993, has jeopardized the reform program, shrunk the tax base, and
disrupted vital economic activity. Although strikes had ended in 1994,
political unrest and lack of funds prevented the government from
taking advantage of the 50% currency devaluation of 12 January 1994.
Resumption of World Bank and IMF flows will depend on implementation
of several controversial moves toward privatization and on downsizing
the military, on which the regime depends to stay in power.

resources greatly restrain economic development and confine
agriculture to the subsistence level. The people must rely on aid from

from sales of copra, postage stamps, souvenir coins, and handicrafts.
Money is also remitted to families from relatives in New Zealand.

Economy

Economy - overview: The economy's base is agriculture, which
contributes 36% to GDP. Squash, coconuts, bananas, and vanilla beans
are the main crops, and agricultural exports make up two-thirds of
total exports. The country must import a high proportion of its food,
mainly from New Zealand. The industrial sector accounts for only 13%
of GDP. Tourism is the primary source of hard currency earnings, but
the country also remains dependent on sizable external aid and
remittances to offset its trade deficit. The economy continued to grow
in 1993-95 largely because of a rise in squash exports, increased aid
flows, and several large construction projects, but contracted in
1995-96. The government is now turning its attention to further
development of the private sector and the reduction of the budget
deficit. Current proposals include selling Tongan citizenship and
passports to foreigners, leasing its seven equatorial satellite spots,
and setting up a joint venture gas production facility with South
Korea.
