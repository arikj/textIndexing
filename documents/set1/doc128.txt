@Italy:Economy

 Overview: Since World War II the Italian economy has changed from one
 based on agriculture into a ranking industrial economy, with
 approximately the same total and per capita output as France and the
 UK. The country is still divided into a developed industrial north,
 dominated by private companies, and an undeveloped agricultural south,
 dominated by large public enterprises. Services account for 48% of
 GDP, industry 35%, agriculture 4%, and public administration 13%. Most
 raw materials needed by industry and over 75% of energy requirements
 must be imported. After growing at an average annual rate of 3% in
 1983-90, growth slowed to about 1% in 1991 and 1992, fell by 0.7% in
 1993, and recovered to 2% in 1994. In the second half of 1992, Rome
 became unsettled by the prospect of not qualifying to participate in
 EU plans for economic and monetary union later in the decade; thus it
 finally began to address its huge fiscal imbalances. Subsequently, the
 government has adopted fairly stringent budgets, abandoned its highly
 inflationary wage indexation system, and started to scale back its
 extremely generous social welfare programs, including pension and
 health care benefits. Monetary officials were forced to withdraw the
 lira from the European monetary system in September 1992 when it came
 under extreme pressure in currency markets. For the 1990s, Italy faces
 the problems of pushing ahead with fiscal reform, refurbishing a
 tottering communications system, curbing pollution in major industrial
 centers, and adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying the
 ongoing expansion and economic integration of the European Union.

@Japan:Economy

 Overview: Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic,
 mastery of high technology, and a comparatively small defense
 allocation (roughly 1% of GDP) have helped Japan advance with
 extraordinary rapidity to the rank of second most powerful economy in
 the world. Industry, the most important sector of the economy, is
 heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels. Usually
 self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of its
 requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of
 the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the
 global catch. Overall economic growth has been spectacular: a 10%
 average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and 1980s. Economic
 growth came to a halt in 1992-93 largely because of contractionary
 domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the
 stock and real estate markets. Growth resumed at a 0.6% pace in 1994
 largely because of consumer demand. As for foreign trade, the stronger
 yen and slower global growth are containing export growth.
 Unemployment and inflation remain remarkably low in comparison with
 the other industrialized nations. Japan continues to run a huge trade
 surplus - $121 billion in 1994, roughly the same size as in 1993 -
 which supports extensive investment in foreign assets. Prime Minister
 MURAYAMA has yet to formalize his government's plans for
 administrative and economic reform, including reduction in the trade
 surplus. As leader of a coalition government, he has softened his own
 socialist positions. The crowding of the habitable land area and the
 aging of the population are two major long-run problems.

@Jersey:Economy

 Overview: The economy is based largely on financial services,
 agriculture, and tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and
 especially flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to the
 UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents
 an important export earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EU
 countries. In 1986 the finance sector overtook tourism as the main
 contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the island's output. In
 recent years the government has encouraged light industry to locate in
 Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry has developed
 alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material
 and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of
 Jersey's food needs.

@Jordan:Economy

 Overview: Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom
 of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when its annual real GNP growth
 averaged more than 10%. In the remainder of the 1980s, however,
 reductions in both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real
 economic growth to an average of roughly 2% per year. Imports - mainly
 oil, capital goods, consumer durables, and food - outstripped exports,
 with the difference covered by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In
 mid-1989, the Jordanian Government began debt-rescheduling
 negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF-supported program designed
 to gradually reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed
 structural reforms. The Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990,
 however, aggravated Jordan's already serious economic problems,
 forcing the government to shelve the IMF program, stop most debt
 payments, and suspend rescheduling negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab
 states, worker remittances, and trade contracted; and refugees flooded
 the country, producing serious balance-of-payments problems, stunting
 GDP growth, and straining government resources. The economy rebounded
 in 1992, largely due to the influx of capital repatriated by workers
 returning from the Gulf, but the recovery was uneven throughout 1994.
 The government is implementing the reform program adopted in 1992 and
 continues to secure rescheduling and write-offs of its heavy foreign
 debt. Debt, poverty, and unemployment remain Jordan's biggest on-going
 problems.
