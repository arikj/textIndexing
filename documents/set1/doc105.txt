@Zaire, Economy

Overview: 
  Zaire's economy has continued to disintegrate. While meaningful
  economic figures are difficult to come by, Zaire's hyperinflation, the
  largest government deficit ever, and plunging mineral production have
  made the country one of the world's poorest. Most formal transactions
  are conducted in hard currency as indigenous banknotes have lost
  almost all value, and a barter economy now flourishes in all but the
  largest cities. Most individuals and families hang on grimly through
  subsistence farming and petty trade. The government has not been able
  to meet its financial obligations to the International Momentary Fund
  or put in place the financial measures advocated by the IMF. Although
  short-term prospects for improvement are dim, improved political
  stability would boost Zaire's long-term potential to effectively
  exploit its vast wealth of mineral and agricultural resources.

  imports and growing foreign debt. Economic difficulties stem from a
  chronically depressed level of copper production and ineffective
  economic policies. In 1991 real GDP fell by 2% and in 1992 by 3% more.
  An annual population growth of 3% has brought a decline in per capita
  GDP of 50% over the past decade. A high inflation rate has also added
  to Zambia's economic woes in recent years.

@Zimbabwe, Economy

Overview: 
  Agriculture employs three-fourths of the labor force and supplies
  almost 40% of exports. The manufacturing sector, based on agriculture
  and mining, produces a variety of goods and contributes 35% to GDP.
  Mining accounts for only 5% of both GDP and employment, but supplies
  of minerals and metals account for about 40% of exports. Wide
  fluctuations in agricultural production over the past six years have
  resulted in an uneven growth rate, one that on average has matched the
  3% annual increase in population. Helped by an IMF/World Bank
  structural adjustment program, output rose 3.5% in 1991. A severe
  drought in 1991/92 caused the economy to contract by about 10% in
  1992.

Note: The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) has dissolved, 
and ceases to exist. None of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia, 
including Serbia and Montenegro, have been permitted to participate solely 
on the basis of the membership of the former Yugoslavia in the United 
Nations General Assembly and Economic and Social Council and their 
subsidiary bodies and in various United Nations Specialized Agencies. The 
United Nations, however, permits the seat and nameplate of the SFRY to 
remain, permits the SFRY mission to continue to function, and continues to 
fly the flag of the former Yugoslavia. For a variety of reasons, a number 
of other organizations have not yet taken action with regard to the 
membership of the former Yugoslavia. The World Factbook therefore continues 
to list Yugoslavia under international organizations where the SFRY seat 
remains or where no action has yet been taken.
