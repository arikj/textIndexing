@Tajikistan:Economy

 Overview: Tajikistan had the next-to-lowest per capita GDP in the
 former USSR, the highest rate of population growth, and an extremely
 low standard of living. Agriculture dominates the economy, cotton
 being the most important crop. Mineral resources, varied but limited
 in amount, include silver, gold, uranium, and tungsten. Industry is
 limited to a large aluminum plant, hydropower facilities, and small
 obsolete factories mostly in light industry and food processing. The
 Tajik economy has been gravely weakened by three years of civil war
 and by the loss of subsidies and markets for its products, which has
 left Tajikistan dependent on Russia and Uzbekistan and on
 international humanitarian assistance for much of its basic
 subsistence needs. Moreover, constant political turmoil and the
 continued dominance by former Communist officials have impeded the
 introduction of meaningful economic reforms. In the meantime,
 Tajikistan's efforts to adopt the Russian ruble as its domestic
 currency despite Russia's unwillingness to supply sufficient rubles
 left the country in a severe monetary crisis throughout 1994, keeping
 inflation low but leaving workers and pensioners unpaid for months at
 a time. The government has announced plans to introduce its own
 currency in 1995 to help resolve the problem.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $8.5 billion (1994
 estimate as extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1992)

 approval of a reform and stabilization plan

@Tanzania:Economy

 Overview: Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. The
 economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about
 58% of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work
 force. Topography and climatic conditions, however, limit cultivated
 crops to only 5% of the land area. Industry accounts for 8% of GDP and
 is mainly limited to processing agricultural products and light
 consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced in mid-1986
 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
 financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank,
 the International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided
 funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure.
 Growth in 1991-94 has featured a pickup in industrial production and a
 substantial increase in output of minerals, led by gold. Recent
 banking reforms have helped increase private sector growth and
 investment.

@Thailand:Economy

 Overview: Thailand's economy recovered rapidly from the political
 unrest in May 1992 to post an impressive 7.5% growth rate for the
 year, 7.8% in 1993, and 8% in 1994. One of the more advanced
 developing countries in Asia, Thailand depends on exports of
 manufactures and the development of the service sector to fuel the
 country's rapid growth. Much of Thailand's recent imports have been
 for capital equipment, suggesting that the export sector is poised for
 further growth. With foreign investment slowing, Bangkok is working to
 increase the generation of domestic capital. Prime Minister CHUAN's
 government - Thailand's fifth government in less than three years - is
 pledged to continue Bangkok's probusiness policies, and the return of
 a democratically elected government has improved business confidence.
 Even so, CHUAN must overcome divisions within his ruling coalition to
 complete much needed infrastructure development programs if Thailand
 is to remain an attractive place for business investment. Over the
 longer-term, Bangkok must produce more college graduates with
 technical training and upgrade workers' skills to continue its rapid
 economic development.

@Togo:Economy

 Overview: The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture,
 which accounts for about half of GDP and provides employment for 80%
 of the labor force. Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coffee,
 and cotton, which together generate about 30% of total export
 earnings. Togo is self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests
 are normal. In the industrial sector phosphate mining is by far the
 most important activity, although it has suffered from the collapse of
 world phosphate prices and increased foreign competition. Togo serves
 as a regional commercial and trade center. The government's
 decade-long IMF and World Bank supported effort to implement economic
 reform measures to encourage foreign investment and bring revenues in
 line with expenditures has stalled. Political unrest, including
 private and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, has
 jeopardized the reform program, shrunk the tax base, and disrupted
 vital economic activity. Although strikes had ended in 1994, political
 unrest and lack of funds prevented the government from taking
 advantage of the 50% currency devaluation of January 1994. Resumption
 of World Bank and IMF flows will depend on implementation of several
 controversial moves toward privatization and on downsizing the
 military, on which the regime depends to stay in power.

 Overview: Tokelau's small size, isolation, and lack of resources
 greatly restrain economic development and confine agriculture to the
 subsistence level. The people must rely on aid from New Zealand to
 maintain public services, annual aid being substantially greater than
 GDP. The principal sources of revenue come from sales of copra,
 postage stamps, souvenir coins, and handicrafts. Money is also
 remitted to families from relatives in New Zealand.

@Tonga:Economy

 Overview: The economy's base is agriculture, which employs about 70%
 of the labor force and contributes 40% to GDP. Squash, coconuts,
 bananas, and vanilla beans are the main crops, and agricultural
 exports make up two-thirds of total exports. The country must import a
 high proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand. The
 manufacturing sector accounts for only 11% of GDP. Tourism is the
 primary source of hard currency earnings, but the country also remains
 dependent on sizable external aid and remittances to offset its trade
 deficit. The economy continued to grow in 1993-94 largely because of a
 rise in squash exports, increased aid flows, and several large
 construction projects. The government is now turning its attention to
 further development of the private sector and the reduction of the
 budget deficit.
