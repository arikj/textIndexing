Economy

Economy - overview: In 1996, Poland continued to make good progress in
the difficult transition to a market economy. The transition began on
1 January 1990, when the new democratic government instituted shock
therapy by decontrolling prices, slashing subsidies, and drastically
reducing import barriers. Although real GDP fell sharply in 1990 and
1991, in 1992 Poland became the first country in the region to resume
economic growth with a 2.6% increase. Growth advanced to 3.8% in 1993,
5.2% in 1994, 6.5% in 1995, and 6.0% in 1996. Most of the growth since
1991 has come from the booming private sector, which now accounts for
more than 60% of GDP, attributable mostly to the creation of new
private firms. Large-scale industry still remains largely in state
hands. The trade and current account balances officially are in
deficit but in fact both have comfortable surpluses because of large,
unrecorded sales to cross-border visitors. The government has promised
to extend privatization and social welfare reform and to maintain
fiscal and monetary discipline. As for external debt, the burden was
sharply reduced by reschedulings and write-offs of both private and
official debt during 1991-95.

Economy

Economy - overview: Portugal's short-term economic fundamentals remain
strong: the economy has grown by more than 2% during the past two
years, with similar growth expected in 1997. The Socialist
government's primary economic goal is to place Portugal in the first
group of countries adopting the single European currency, and it has
instituted a disciplined 1997 budget to bolster Lisbon's chances.
Portuguese government forecasts suggest that it is likely to meet
partially the Maastricht monetary convergence criteria by lowering its
budget deficit from 4% of GDP in 1996 to 2.9% in 1997, although the
government predicts that government debt will be cut only to 68% of
GDP, overshooting Maastricht's 60% target. Social programs - a
priority for the Socialists - will still grow slightly faster than GDP
in 1997, mandating strict budget discipline in other areas. As for the
long run, Portugal is increasing its infrastructure spending - much of
it in anticipation of hosting the world's International Exposition in
1998 - while working to modernize its capital plant and increase
competitiveness in hopes of increasing Portugal's GDP, which remains
below 65% of the EU's average GDP per capita.

Economy

Economy - overview: Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies
in the Caribbean region. A diverse industrial sector has surpassed
agriculture as the primary locus of economic activity and income.
Encouraged by duty-free access to the US and by tax incentives, US
firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s. US minimum
wage laws apply. Sugar production has lost out to dairy production and
other livestock products as the main source of income in the
agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important
source of income for the island, with estimated arrivals of nearly 3.9
million tourists in 1993.
