@American Samoa, Economy

Overview: 
  Economic activity is strongly linked to the US, with which American
  Samoa conducts 80%-90% of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna
  processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned
  tuna the primary export. The tuna canneries and the government are by
  far the two largest employers. Other economic activities include a
  slowly developing tourist industry. Transfers from the US Government
  add substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being.

@Andorra, Economy

Overview: 
  Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's economy, accounts for roughly 80%
  of GDP. An estimated 13 million tourists visit annually, attracted by
  Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. The
  banking sector, with its "tax haven" status, also contributes
  substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited by a
  scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The
  principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists
  mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra is a member of
  the EU Customs Union; it is unclear what effect the European Single
  Market will have on the advantages Andorra obtains from its duty-free
  status.

  refused to accept its defeat in internationally monitored elections;
  fighting has since resumed throughout much of the countryside.
  Nevertheless, the two sides are negotiating the details for holding

@Angola, Economy

Overview: 
  Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 80-90% of the
  population but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil production is
  vital to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. Bitter internal
  fighting continues to severely affect the economy, and food must be
  imported. In 1993, production fell by an estimated 22.6%, mainly
  because of the capture by insurgents of the oil town of Soyo and
  diamond-producing areas in northeastern Angola. Angola has rich
  natural resources - notably gold, diamonds, and arable land, in
  addition to large oil depoaits - but will need to end the war and
  reform government policies if it is to achieve its potential.

  14 million sq km (est.)
comparative area: 
  slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US
note: 
  second-smallest continent (after Australia)
Land boundaries: 
  none, but see entry on International disputes
Coastline: 
  17,968 km 
Maritime claims: 
  none, but see entry on International Disputes
International disputes: 
  Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctic Treaty Summary below);
  sections (some overlapping) claimed by Argentina, Australia, Chile,
  France (Adelie Land), New Zealand (Ross Dependency), Norway (Queen
  Maud Land), and UK; the US and most other nations do not recognize the
  territorial claims of other nations and have made no claims themselves
  (the US reserves the right to do so); no formal claims have been made
  in the sector between 90 degrees west and 150 degrees west
Climate: 
  severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance
  from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because
  of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate
  climate; higher temperatures occur in January along the coast and
  average slightly below freezing
Terrain: 
  about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with average
  elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges up to 4,897
  meters high; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria
  Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and parts of Ross
  Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves along about half of
  the coastline, and floating ice shelves constitute 11% of the area of
  the continent
Natural resources: 
  none presently exploited; iron ore, chromium, copper, gold, nickel,
  platinum and other minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been found
  in small, uncommercial quantities

  in October 1991 it was reported that the ozone shield, which protects
  the Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation, had dwindled
  to the lowest level recorded over Antarctica since 1975 when
  measurements were first taken
natural hazards: 
  katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from the high
  interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau;
  cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise along the
  coast; volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of West
  Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak

Antarctic Treaty Summary: 
  The Antarctic Treaty, signed on 1 December 1959 and entered into force
  on 23 June 1961, establishes the legal framework for the management of
  Antarctica. Administration is carried out through consultative member
  meetings - the 18th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was in Japan
  in April 1993. Currently, there are 42 treaty member nations: 26
  consultative and 16 acceding. Consultative (voting) members include
  the seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica as national
  territory (some claims overlap) and 19 nonclaimant nations. The US and
  some other nations that have made no claims have reserved the right to
  do so. The US does not recognize the claims of others. The year in
  parentheses indicates when an acceding nation was voted to full
  consultative (voting) status, while no date indicates the country was
  an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations are - Argentina,
  Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant
  consultative nations are - Belgium, Brazil (1983), China (1985),
  Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy
  (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989),
  Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay
  (1985), the US, and Russia.
  Acceding (nonvoting) members, with year of accession in parentheses,
  are - Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978), Canada (1988), Colombia (1988),
  Cuba (1984), Czech Republic (1993), Denmark (1965), Greece (1987),
  Guatemala (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea
  (1981), Romania (1971), Slovakia (1993), Switzerland (1990), and
  Ukraine (1992).
Article 1: 
  area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity, such as
  weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel and equipment
  may be used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose
Article 2: 
  freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation shall continue
Article 3: 
  free exchange of information and personnel in cooperation with the UN
  and other international agencies
Article 4: 
  does not recognize, dispute, or establish territorial claims and no
  new claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force
Article 5: 
  prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes
Article 6: 
  includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees
  00 minutes south
Article 7: 
  treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial observation,
  to any area and may inspect all stations, installations, and
  equipment; advance notice of all activities and of the introduction of
  military personnel must be given
Article 8: 
  allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own
  states
Article 9: 
  frequent consultative meetings take place among member nations
Article 10: 
  treaty states will discourage activities by any country in Antarctica
  that are contrary to the treaty
Article 11: 
  disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or,
  ultimately, by the ICJ
Article 12, 13, 14: 
  deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among
  involved nations
Other agreements: 
  more than 170 recommendations adopted at treaty consultative meetings
  and ratified by governments include - Agreed Measures for the
  Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964); Convention for the
  Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention on the Conservation
  of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (1980); a mineral resources
  agreement was signed in 1988 but was subsequently rejected; in 1991
  the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was
  signed and awaits ratification; this agreement provides for the
  protection of the Antarctic environment through five specific annexes
  on marine pollution, fauna, and flora, environmental impact
  assessments, waste management, and protected areas; it also prohibits
  all activities relating to mineral resources except scientific
  research; nine parties have ratified Protocol as of April 1994
Legal system: 
  US law, including certain criminal offenses by or against US
  nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under jurisdiction
  of other countries. Some US laws directly apply to Antarctica. For
  example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. section 2401 et
  seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the following
  activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute: The taking of
  native mammals or birds; the introduction of nonindigenous plants and
  animals; entry into specially protected or scientific areas; the
  discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the importation into the US
  of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of the Antarctic
  Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines and 1
  year in prison. The Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Transportation,
  and Interior share enforcement responsibilities. Public Law 95-541,
  the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires expeditions from
  the US to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the Office of Oceans and
  Polar Affairs, Room 5801, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520,
  which reports such plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic
  Treaty. For more information contact Permit Office, Office of Polar
  Programs, National Science Foundation, Arlington, Virginia 22230

@Antigua and Barbuda, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy is primarily service oriented, with tourism the most
  important determinant of economic performance. During the period
  1986-91, real GDP expanded at an annual average rate of about 6%.
  Tourism makes a direct contribution to GDP of about 13% and also
  affects growth in other sectors - particularly in construction,
  communications, and public utilities. In 1992, reduced government
  capital spending and private sector investment, dampened by recession
  in the major world economies, slowed economic growth.

  Islands (Russia) to Denmark Strait (between Greenland and Iceland);
  the ice pack is surrounded by open seas during the summer, but more
  than doubles in size during the winter and extends to the encircling
  land masses; the ocean floor is about 50% continental shelf (highest
  percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a central basin

  icing from October to May; strategic location between North America
  and Russia; shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern and
  western Russia, floating research stations operated by the US and
  Russia; maximum snow cover in March or April about 20 to 50
  centimeters over the frozen ocean and lasts about 10 months

@Argentina, Economy

Overview: 
  Argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly literate
  population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified
  industrial base. Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and
  statist policies, the economy in the late 1980s was plagued with huge
  external debts and recurring bouts of hyperinflation. Elected in 1989,
  in the depths of recession, President MENEM has implemented a
  comprehensive economic restructuring program that shows signs of
  putting Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable growth. Argentina's
  currency has traded at par with the US dollar since April 1991, and
  inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20 years. Argentines have
  responded to the relative price stability by repatriating flight
  capital and investing in domestic industry. Growth slowed somewhat in
  1993 but Argentina still registered an impressive 6% advance, fueled
  largely by inflows of foreign capital and strong domestic consumption
  spending. The government's major short term objective is encouraging
  exports, e.g., by reducing domestic costs of production. Much remains
  to be done in the 1990s in dismantling the old statist barriers to
  growth and in solidifying the recent economic gains.
