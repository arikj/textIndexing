@Guinea-bissau:Economy

 Overview: Although possessing major mineral and hydropower resources
 and considerable potential for agricultural development, Guinea
 remains one of the poorest countries in the world. The agricultural
 sector contributes about 40% to GDP and employs 80% of the work force,
 while industry accounts for 27% of GDP. Guinea possesses over 25% of
 the world's bauxite reserves. The mining sector accounted for 85% of
 exports in 1991. Long-run improvements in literacy, financial
 institutions, and the legal framework are needed if the country is to
 move out of poverty. Except in the bauxite industry, foreign
 investment remains minimal.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $6.3 billion (1994
 est.)

@Guinea:Economy

 Overview: Guinea-Bissau ranks among the poorest countries in the
 world. Agriculture and fishing are the main economic activities.
 Cashew nuts, peanuts, and palm kernels are the primary exports.
 Exploitation of known mineral deposits is unlikely at present because
 of a weak infrastructure and the high cost of development. With IMF
 support the country is committed to an economic reform program
 emphasizing monetary stability and private sector growth. This process
 will continue at a slow pace because of a heavy foreign debt burden
 and internal constraints.

@Guyana:Economy

 Overview: Guyana, one of the poorest countries in the Western
 Hemisphere, has pushed ahead strongly in 1992-94, with an 8% average
 annual economic growth rate, led by gold mining, and rice, sugar, and
 forestry products for export. Favorable factors include recovery in
 the key agricultural and mining sectors, a more favorable atmosphere
 for business initiative, a more realistic exchange rate, a sharp drop
 in the inflation rate, and the continued support of international
 organizations. Serious underlying economic problems will continue.
 Electric power has been in short supply and constitutes a major
 barrier to future gains in national output. The government will have
 to persist in efforts to manage its large $2.2 billion external debt,
 control inflation, and to extend the privatization program.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $1.4 billion (1994
 est.)

 National product real growth rate: 8.5% (1994 est.)

@Haiti:Economy

 Overview: About 75% of the population live in abject poverty.
 Agriculture is mainly small-scale subsistence farming and employs
 two-thirds of the work force. The majority of the population does not
 have ready access to safe drinking water, adequate medical care, or
 sufficient food. The lack of employment opportunities remains one of
 the most critical problems facing the economy, along with soil erosion
 and political instability. International trade sanctions in response
 to the September 1991 coup against President ARISTIDE further damaged
 the economy. The restoration of President ARISTIDE, the lifting of
 sanctions in late 1994, and foreign aid will alleviate some economic
 problems. Haiti will continue to depend heavily on foreign aid.
