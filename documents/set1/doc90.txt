@Nauru, Economy

Overview: 
  Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves of which are
  expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have given
  Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World -
  $10,000 annually. Few other resources exist, so most necessities must
  be imported, including fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation
  of mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are
  serious long-term problems. Substantial amounts of phosphate income
  are invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition.

@Nepal, Economy

Overview: 
  Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world.
  Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for
  over 90% of the population and accounting for 60% of GDP. Industrial
  activity is limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural
  produce (jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles
  and carpets has expanded recently and accounted for 85% of foreign
  exchange earnings in FY94. Apart from agricultural land and forests,
  exploitable natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism.
  Agricultural production in the late 1980s grew by about 5%, as
  compared with annual population growth of 2.6%. More than 40% of the
  population is undernourished. Since May 1991, the government has been
  encouraging trade and foreign investment, e.g., by eliminating
  business licenses and registration requirements in order to simplify
  domestic and foreign investment. The government also has been cutting
  public expenditures by reducing subsidies, privatizing state
  industries, and laying off civil servants. Prospects for foreign trade
  and investment in the 1990s remain poor, however, because of the small
  size of the economy, its technological backwardness, its remoteness,
  and susceptibility to natural disaster. Nepal experienced severe
  flooding in August 1993 which caused at least $50 million in damage to
  the country's infrastructure.

@Netherlands, Economy

Overview: 
  This highly developed and affluent economy is based on private
  enterprise. The government makes its presence felt, however, through
  many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare programs affecting
  most aspects of economic activity. The trade and financial services
  sector contributes over 50% of GDP. Industrial activity provides about
  25% of GDP and is led by the food-processing, oil-refining, and
  metalworking industries. The highly mechanized agricultural sector
  employs only 5% of the labor force, but provides large surpluses for
  export and the domestic food-processing industry. Rising unemployment
  and a sizable budget deficit are currently the most serious economic
  problems. Many of the economic issues of the 1990s will reflect the
  course of European economic integration.

@New Zealand, Economy

Overview: 
  Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian economy
  dependent on a guaranteed British market to a more industrialized,
  open free market economy that can compete on the global scene. The
  government has hoped that dynamic growth would boost real incomes,
  broaden and deepen the technological capabilities of the industrial
  sector, reduce inflationary pressures, and permit the expansion of
  welfare benefits. The results have been mixed: inflation is down from
  double-digit levels, but growth was sluggish in 1988-91. In 1992-93,
  growth picked up to 3% annually, a sign that the new economic approach
  is beginning to pay off. Business confidence has strengthened, and the
  inflation remains among the lowest in the industrial world.
  Unemployment, down from 11% in 1991, remains unacceptably high at 9%.
