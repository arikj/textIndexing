@Tonga, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy's base is agriculture, which employs about 70% of the
  labor force and contributes 40% to GDP. Coconuts, bananas, and vanilla
  beans are the main crops and make up two-thirds of exports. The
  country must import a high proportion of its food, mainly from New
  Zealand. The manufacturing sector accounts for only 11% of GDP.
  Tourism is the primary source of hard currency earnings, but the
  island remains dependent on sizable external aid and remittances to
  offset its trade deficit. The economy continued to grow in 1993
  largely because of a rise in squash exports, increased aid flows, and
  several large construction projects. The government is now turning its
  attention to further development of the private sector and the
  reduction of the budget deficit.

@Trinidad and Tobago, Economy

Overview: 
  Trinidad and Tobago's petroleum-based economy still enjoys a high per
  capita income by Latin American standards, even though output and
  living standards are substantially below the boom years of 1973-82.
  The country suffers from widespread unemployment, large foreign-debt
  payments, and periods of low international oil prices. Seven
  successive years of economic contraction were followed by small gains
  in output in 1990-91 of 1.2% and 0.9%, in turn followed by small
  declines in 1992-93 of roughly 1.0%. The government has begun to make
  progress in its efforts to diversify exports.

@Tunisia, Economy

Overview: 
  Tunisia has a diverse economy, with important agricultural, mining,
  energy, tourism and manufacturing sectors. The economy grew rapidly in
  the mid-1980s, GDP growth averaging 5.4% in 1983-85. Following a
  foreign exchange crisis caused by a sharp drop in agricultural output
  and tourism, combined with the oil price collapse in 1986, Tunisia
  inaugurated an IMF-sponsored economic rehabilitation scheme.
  Subsequent government structural reforms have helped liberalize and
  open the economy, and GDP growth has been positive since the start of
  the program. A sharp rebound in tourism from the downturn caused by
  the Gulf war and strong agricultural performance boosted real GDP
  growth to more than 8% in 1992; growth fell back to 2.6% in 1993.
  Further privatization and further improvements in government
  administrative efficiency are among the challenges for the future.

@Turkey, Economy

Overview: 
  In early 1994, after an impressive economic performance through most
  of the 1980s, Turkey faces its most damaging economic crisis in the
  last 15 years. Sparked by the downgrading in mid-January of Turkey's
  international credit rating by two US credit rating agencies, the
  crisis stems from two years of loose fiscal and monetary policies that
  have exacerbated inflation and allowed the public debt, money supply,
  and current account deficit to explode. Under Prime Minister CILLER,
  Ankara has followed seriously flawed policies that have destroyed
  public confidence in the government's ability to manage the economy.
  Inflation is now running at an annual rate of 107% and the public
  sector deficit is equivalent to 16% of GDP. Turkish firms have been
  hurt by high interest rates and a dramatic drop in consumer demand.
  Three Turkish banks have folded and the stock market has fallen 48%
  since the beginning of the year. Economic growth may drop to between
  0% and 2% in 1994, compared to 7.3% in 1993. Moreover, the government
  is facing a severe cash crunch. In March 1994, the treasury came close
  to defaulting on a loan, and official foreign currency reserves are
  equal to less than two months' worth of imports. The unprecedented
  effort by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to raise the economic
  costs of its insurgency against the Turkish state is adding to
  Turkey's economic problems. Attacks against the tourism industry have
  cut tourist revenues, which account for about 3% of GDP, while
  economic activity in southeastern Turkey, where most of the violence
  occurs, has dropped considerably. To cope with the economic crisis and
  instill domestic and international investor confidence in the fragile
  coalition government, CILLER has asked the IMF to endorse a
  stabilization package she introduced in early April 1994. Negotiations
  are underway for a standby agreement, which would give Turkey access
  to $450 million this year and enable her cash-starved government to
  return to the foreign capital markets.

@Turkmenistan, Economy

Overview: 
  Turkmenistan is a largely desert country with nomadic cattle raising,
  intensive agriculture in irrigated oases, and huge gas and oil
  resources. Half of its irrigated land is planted in cotton; it is the
  world's tenth largest producer. It also is the world's fourth largest
  producer of natural gas and has the fifth largest reserves.
  Furthermore, Turkmenistan has substantial oil resources; its two oil
  refineries make it an exporter of refined products. Profiting from the
  move toward market prices for its oil and gas resources, Turkmenistan
  has suffered the least economic decline of the 15 states of the former
  USSR. With an authoritarian ex-Communist regime in power and a
  tribally based social structure, Turkmenistan has taken a cautious
  approach to questions of economic reform, using the profits from its
  gas and cotton exports to sustain a generally inefficient economy.
  Economic restructuring and privatization have just begun, and price
  liberalization and price increases have been accompanied by generous
  wage hikes and subsidies. At the same time, Turkmenistan faces serious
  constraints on its gas and oil earnings because of the inability of
  its traditional regional customers to pay for the current level of
  purchases and the lack of pipeline access to hard currency markets.
  Faced with financial shortfalls, rampant inflation, and the desire to
  ensure a stable currency, the regime has become more receptive to
  market reforms yet still seeks to offer widespread social benefits to
  its population and to retain state domination over the economy.
National product: 
  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $13 billion (1993 estimate from
