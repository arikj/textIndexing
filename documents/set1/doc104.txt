@West Bank, Economy

Overview: 
  Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli
  military administration and the effects of the Palestinian uprising
  (intifadah). Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable
  investment have been discouraged by a lack of local capital and
  restrictive Israeli policies. Capital investment consists largely of
  residential housing, not productive assets that would enable local
  Palestinian firms to compete with Israeli industry. A major share of
  GNP has traditionally been derived from remittances of workers
  employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states. Such transfers from the
  Gulf dropped after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake of
  the Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West
  Bank, increasing unemployment, and export revenues have dropped
  because of the decline of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states.
  Israeli measures to curtail the intifadah also have added to
  unemployment and lowered living standards. The area's economic
  situation has worsened since Israel's partial closure of the
  territories in 1993.

@Western Samoa, Economy

Overview: 
  Agriculture employs more than half of the labor force, contributes 50%
  to GDP, and furnishes 90% of exports. The bulk of export earnings
  comes from the sale of coconut oil and copra. The economy depends on
  emigrant remittances and foreign aid to support a level of imports
  much greater than export earnings. Tourism has become the most
  important growth industry, and construction of the first international
  hotel is under way. The economy continued to falter in 1993, as
  remittances and tourist earnings fell off. A fungal plant disease
  severely damaged the taro crop, the primary food and export crop.

@World, Economy

Overview: 
  Real global output - gross world product (GWP) - rose roughly 2% in
  1993, with results varying widely among regions and countries. Average
  growth of 1% in the GDP of industrialized countries (57% of GWP in
  1993) and average growth of 6% in the GDP of less developed countries
  (37% of GWP) were partly offset by a further 10% drop in the GDP of
  the former USSR/Eastern Europe area (now only 6% of GWP). Within the
  industrialized world the US posted a 3% growth rate whereas both Japan
  and the 12-member European Union (formerly the European Community) had
  zero growth. With the notable exception of Japan at 2.5%, unemployment
  was typically 6-11% in the industrial world. The US accounted for 22%
  of GWP in 1993; Western Europe accounted for 22.5%; and Japan
  accounted for 9%. These are the three "economic superpowers" which are
  presumably destined to compete for mastery in international markets on
  into the 21st century. As for the less developed countries, China,
  India, and the Four Dragons--South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
  Singapore--once again posted good records; however, many other
  countries, especially in Africa, continued to suffer from drought,
  rapid population growth, inflation, and civil strife. Central Europe,
  especially Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, made considerable
  progress in moving toward "market-friendly" economies, whereas the 15
  ex-Soviet countries typically experienced further declines in output
  of 10-15%. Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock
  economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over
  international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.
  Internally, the central government in a number of cases is losing
  control over resources as separatist regional movements - typically
  based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of
  the former Soviet Union, in former Yugoslavia, and in India. In
  Western Europe, governments face the difficult political problem of
  channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase
  investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The addition
  of nearly 100 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe
  is exacerbating the problems of pollution, desertification,
  underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of their own internal
  problems, the industrialized countries have inadequate resources to
  deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world, which, at least
  from the economic point of view, are becoming further marginalized.

production:

consumption per capita: 
  2,150 kWh (1990)
Industries: 
  industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology,
  especially in computers, robotics, telecommunications, and medicines
  and medical equipment; most of these advances take place in OECD
  nations; only a small portion of non-OECD countries have succeeded in
  rapidly adjusting to these technological forces, and the technological
  gap between the industrial nations and the less-developed countries
  continues to widen; the rapid development of new industrial (and
  agricultural) technology is complicating already grim environmental
  problems
Agriculture: 
  the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the
  last 20 years; the annual production of cereals, for instance, has
  risen by 50%, from about 1.2 billion metric tons to about 1.8 billion
  metric tons; production increases have resulted mainly from increased
  yields rather than increases in planted areas; while global production
  is sufficient for aggregate demand, about one-fifth of the world's
  population remains malnourished, primarily because local production
  cannot adequately provide for large and rapidly growing populations,
  which are too poor to pay for food imports; conditions are especially
  bad in Africa where drought in recent years has intensified the
  consequences of overpopulation

@Yemen, Economy

Overview: 
  Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of a united
  Yemen, the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port facilities,
  is the economic and commercial capital. Future economic development
  depends heavily on Western-assisted development of its moderate oil
  resources. Former South Yemen's willingness to merge stemmed partly
  from the steady decline in Soviet economic support. The low level of
  domestic industry and agriculture have made northern Yemen dependent
  on imports for practically all of its essential needs. Large trade
  deficits have been compensated for by remittances from Yemenis working
  abroad and by foreign aid. Because of the Gulf crisis, remittances
  have dropped substantially. Once self-sufficient in food production,
  northern Yemen has become a major importer. Land once used for export
  crops - cotton, fruit, and vegetables - has been turned over to
  growing a shrub called qat, whose leaves are chewed for their
  stimulant effect by Yemenis and which has no  significant export
  market. Economic growth in former South Yemen has been constrained by
  a lack of incentives, partly stemming from centralized control over
  production decisions, investment allocation, and import choices.
  Nominal growth in 1994-95 is apt to be under 3% annually because of
  low oil prices and political deadlock that is causing a lack of
  economic cooperation and leadership.
