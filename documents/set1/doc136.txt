@New Zealand:Economy

 Overview: Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian
 economy dependent on a guaranteed British market to a more
 industrialized, open free market economy that can compete on the
 global scene. The government has hoped that dynamic growth would boost
 real incomes, broaden and deepen the technological capabilities of the
 industrial sector, reduce inflationary pressures, and permit the
 expansion of welfare benefits. The initial results were mixed:
 inflation is down from double-digit levels, but growth was sluggish in
 1988-91. In 1992-93, growth picked up to 3% annually, a sign that the
 new economic approach was beginning to pay off. Business confidence
 strengthened in 1994, and export demand picked up in the Asia-Pacific
 region, resulting in 6.2% growth. Inflation remains among the lowest
 in the industrial world.

@Nicaragua:Economy

 Overview: Since March 1991, when President CHAMORRO began an ambitious
 economic stabilization program, Nicaragua has had considerable success
 in reducing inflation and obtaining substantial economic aid from
 abroad. Annual inflation fell from more than 750% in 1991 to less than
 5% in 1992. Inflation rose again to an estimated 20% in 1993, although
 this increase was due almost entirely to a large currency devaluation
 in January. As of early 1994, the government was close to finalizing
 an enhanced structural adjustment facility with the IMF, after the
 previous standby facility expired in early 1993. Despite these
 successes, achieving overall economic growth in an economy scarred by
 misguided economic values and civil war during the 1980s has proved
 elusive. Economic growth was flat in 1992 and slightly negative in
 1993. Nicaragua's per capita foreign debt is one of the highest in the
 world; nonetheless, as of late 1993, Nicaragua was current on its
 post-1988 debt as well as on payments to the international financial
 institutions. Definition of property rights remains a problem;
 ownership disputes over large tracts of land, businesses, and homes
 confiscated by the previous government have yet to be resolved. A rise
 in exports of coffee and other products led growth in 1994.

@Niger:Economy

 Overview: Niger is one of the world's poorest countries, with GDP
 growth lagging behind the rapid growth of population. The economy is
 centered on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry, and reexport
 trade, and increasingly less on uranium, its major export throughout
 the 1970s and 1980s. Uranium revenues dropped by almost 50% between
 1983 and 1990 with the end of the uranium boom. Terms of trade with
 Nigeria, Niger's largest regional trade partner, have improved
 dramatically since the 50% devaluation of the African franc in January
 1994; this devaluation boosted exports of livestock, peas, onions, and
 the products of Niger's small cotton industry. The government relies
 on bilateral and multilateral aid for operating expenses and public
 investment and is strongly induced to adhere to structural adjustment
 programs designed by the IMF and the World Bank.

@Nigeria:Economy

 Overview: The oil-rich Nigerian economy continues to be hobbled by
 political instability and poor macroeconomic management. Nigeria's
 unpopular military rulers show no sign of wanting to restore
 democratic civilian rule in the near future and appear divided on how
 to redress fundamental economic imbalances that cause troublesome
 inflation and the steady depreciation of the naira. The government's
 domestic and international arrears continue to limit economic growth -
 even in the oil sector - and prevent an agreement with the IMF and
 bilateral creditors on debt relief. The inefficient (largely
 subsistence) agricultural sector has failed to keep up with rapid
 population growth, and Nigeria, once a large net exporter of food, now
 must import food.

@Niue:Economy

 Overview: The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New Zealand.
 Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall
 made up by grants from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages
 to public employees. The agricultural sector consists mainly of
 subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are grown for export.
 Industry consists primarily of small factories to process passion
 fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps
 to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in
 recent years has suffered a serious loss of population because of
 migration of Niueans to New Zealand.

 Overview: The primary economic activity is tourism, which has brought
 a level of prosperity unusual among inhabitants of the Pacific
 islands. The number of visitors has increased steadily over the years

 island a favorable balance of trade and helped the agricultural sector
 to become self-sufficient in the production of beef, poultry, and
 eggs.
