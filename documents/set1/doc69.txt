@Bosnia and Herzegovina, Economy

Overview: 
  Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former Yugoslav Republic of
  Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old Yugoslav federation.
  Although agriculture has been almost all in private hands, farms have
  been small and inefficient, and the republic traditionally has been a
  net importer of food. Industry has been greatly overstaffed, one
  reflection of the rigidities of Communist central planning and
  management. Tito had pushed the development of military industries in
  the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of
  Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of April 1994, Bosnia and Herzegovina
  was being torn apart by the continued bitter interethnic warfare that
  has caused production to plummet, unemployment and inflation to soar,
  and human misery to multiply. No reliable economic statistics for
  1992-93 are available, although output clearly has fallen
  substantially below the levels of earlier years.

Agriculture: 
  accounted for 9.0% of GDP in 1989; regularly produces less than 50% of
  food needs; the foothills of northern Bosnia support orchards,
  vineyards, livestock, and some wheat and corn; long winters and heavy

@Botswana, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy has historically been based on cattle raising and crops.
  Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80% of the
  population, but produces only about 50% of food needs. The driving
  force behind the rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been
  the mining industry. This sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds,
  has gone from generating 25% of GDP in 1980 to 50% in 1991. No other
  sector has experienced such growth, especially not agriculture, which
  is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor soils. The unemployment rate
  remains a problem at 25%. Although diamond production was down
  slightly in 1992, substantial gains in coal output and manufacturing
  helped boost the economy. Recovery in sluggish diamond markets in
  second half 1993 helped Botswana achieve moderate growth of 3% for the
  year.

@Brazil, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing sectors,
  entered the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway inflation, an
  unserviceable foreign debt of $122 billion, and a lack of policy
  direction. In addition, the economy remained highly regulated,
  inward-looking, and protected by substantial trade and investment
  barriers. Ownership of major industrial and mining facilities is
  divided among private interests - including several multinationals -
  and the government. Most large agricultural holdings are private, with
  the government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts between
  large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent
  violence. The COLLOR government, which assumed office in March 1990,
  launched an ambitious reform program that sought to modernize and
  reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices, deregulating the
  economy, and opening it to increased foreign competition. The
  government also obtained an IMF standby loan in January 1992 and
  reached agreements with commercial bankers on the repayment of
  interest arrears and on the reduction of debt and debt service
  payments. Galloping inflation (the rate doubled in 1992 and by March
  1994 had risen to 42% per month) continues to undermine economic
  stability. Itamar FRANCO, who assumed the presidency following
  President COLLOR'S resignation in December 1992, was out of step with
  COLLOR'S reform agenda; initiatives to redress fiscal problems,
  privatize state enterprises, and liberalize trade and investment
  policies have lost momentum. Brazil's natural resources remain a
  major, long-term economic strength

@British Virgin Islands, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean area, is
  highly dependent on the tourist industry, which generates about 21% of
  the national income. In 1985 the government offered offshore
  registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the islands, and,
  in consequence, incorporation fees generated about $2 million in 1987.
  The economy slowed in 1991 because of the poor performances of the
  tourist sector and tight commercial bank credit. Livestock raising is
  the most significant agricultural activity. The islands' crops,
  limited by poor soils, are unable to meet food requirements.
