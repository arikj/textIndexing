@Canada, Economy

Overview: 
  As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today closely
  resembles the US in per capita output, market-oriented economic
  system, and pattern of production. Since World War II the impressive
  growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has
  transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily
  industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada registered one of the
  highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations, averaging about
  3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and
  modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects,
  although the country still faces high unemployment and a growing debt.
  Moreover, the continuing constitutional impasse between English- and
  French-speaking areas has observers discussing a possible split in the
  confederation; foreign investors have become edgy.

@Cape Verde, Economy

Overview: 
  Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural resource base,
  a serious, long-term drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is
  service oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services
  accounting for 60% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives
  in rural areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 20%; the fishing
  sector accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The
  fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. In
  1988 fishing represented only 3.5% of GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a
  high trade deficit, financed by remittances from emigrants and foreign
  aid. Economic reforms launched by the new democratic government in
  February 1991 are aimed at developing the private sector and
  attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.

@Cayman Islands, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy depends heavily on tourism (70% of GDP and 75% of foreign
  currency earnings) and offshore financial services, with the tourist
  industry aimed at the luxury market and catering mainly to visitors
  from North America. About 90% of the islands' food and consumer goods

  industry for 54%. Important constraints to economic development

  and a weak human resource base. Multilateral and bilateral development
  assistance, particularly from France, plays a major role in providing
  capital for new investment.

Overview: 
  Climate, geographic remoteness, poor resource endowment, and lack of
  infrastructure make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries in
  the world. Its economy is hobbled by political turmoil, conflict with
  Libya, drought, and food shortages. Consequently the economy has shown
  little progress in recent years in overcoming a severe setback brought
  on by civil war in the late 1980s. Over 80% of the work force is
  involved in subsistence farming and fishing. Cotton is the major cash
  crop, accounting for at least half of exports. Chad is highly
  dependent on foreign aid, especially food credits, given chronic
  shortages in several regions. The government hopes that discovery of
  several oil deposits near Lake Chad will lead to economic revival and
  a windfall in government revenues by 2000.

@Chile, Economy

Overview: 
  Chile has a prosperous, essentially free market economy, with the
  degree of government intervention varying according to the philosophy
  of the different regimes. Under the center-left government of

  welfare has risen steadily. At the same time business investment,
  exports and consumer spending have also grown substantially. The new
  president, FREI, who takes office in March 1994, is expected to
  emphasize social spending even more. Growth in 1991-93 has averaged 8%
