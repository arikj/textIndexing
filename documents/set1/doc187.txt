Economy

Economy - overview: Nepal is among the poorest and least developed
countries in the world with about 60% of the population living below
the poverty line. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,
providing a livelihood for over 80% of the population and accounting
for more than 40% of GDP. Industrial activity is limited, mainly
involving the processing of agricultural produce including jute,
sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Production of textiles and carpets has
expanded recently and accounted for about 80% of foreign exchange
earnings in the past two years. Apart from agricultural land and
forests, exploitable natural resources are mica, hydropower, and
tourism. Agricultural production is growing about 5% on average as
compared with annual population growth of 2.5%. Since May 1991, the
government has been moving forward with economic reforms particularly
those that encourage trade and foreign investment, e.g., by
eliminating business licenses and registration requirements in order
to simplify investment procedures. The government has also been
cutting expenditures by reducing subsidies, privatizing state
industries, and laying off civil servants. The government made some
progress in 1996, signing trade agreements with countries including
India, and attracting substantial foreign investment in hydropower.
Prospects for foreign trade and investment in areas besides hydropower
and tourism will continue to remain poor because of the small size of
the economy, its technological backwardness, its remoteness, and its
landlocked geographic location highly susceptible to natural disaster.
The international community provides funding for more than 60% of
Nepal's development budget and more than 30% of total budgetary
expenditures.

Economy

Economy - overview: This highly developed and affluent economy is
based on private enterprise. The government makes its presence felt,
however, through many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare
programs affecting most aspects of economic activity. Industrial
activity features food-processing, oil-refining, and metalworking. The
highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 4% of the labor
force but provides large surpluses for export and the domestic
food-processing industry. Indeed, the Netherlands ranks third
worldwide in value of agricultural exports, behind the US and France.
Sharp cuts in subsidy and social security spending have been

Economy

Economy - overview: New Caledonia has more than 20% of the world's
known nickel resources. In recent years, the economy has suffered
because of depressed international demand for nickel, the principal
source of export earnings. Only a negligible amount of the land is
suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 25% of imports.
In addition to nickel, financial support from France and tourism are
key to the health of the economy.

Economy

Economy - overview: Since 1984 the government has accomplished major
economic restructuring from an agrarian economy dependent on a
concessionary British market access toward a more industrialized,
open, free market economy that can compete globally. This dynamic
growth has boosted real incomes, broadened and deepened the
technological capabilities of the industrial sector, and contained
inflationary pressures. Business confidence strengthened in 1994, and
export demand picked up in the Asia-Pacific region, resulting in 6.2%
growth. Growth continued strong in 1995, but tailed off in 1996.
Inflation remains among the lowest in the industrial world. Per capita
GDP now is up to the levels of the big West European economies.
