@Kiribati, Economy

Overview: 
  The country has few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate
  deposits were exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and
  fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has
  fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP declined about 8% in 1987,
  as the fish catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the level of 1986
  and copra production was hampered by repeated rains. Output rebounded
  strongly in 1988, with real GDP growing by 17%. The upturn in economic
  growth came from an increase in copra production and a good fish
  catch. Following the strong surge in output in 1988, GNP increased 1%
  in both 1989 and 1990.

@Korea, North, Economy

Overview: 
  More than 90% of this command economy is socialized; agricultural land
  is collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95% of
  manufactured goods. State control of economic affairs is unusually
  tight even for a Communist country because of the small size and
  homogeneity of the society and the strict rule of KIM Il-song and his
  son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during the period 1984-88 averaged
  2%-3%, but output declined by 3%-5% annually during 1989-92 because of
  systemic problems and disruptions in socialist-style economic
  relations with the former USSR and China. In 1992, output dropped
  sharply, by perhaps 7%-9%, as the economy felt the cumulative effect
  of the reduction in outside support. The leadership insisted on
  maintaining its high level of military outlays from a shrinking
  economic pie. Moreover, a serious drawdown in inventories and critical
  shortages in the energy sector have led to increasing interruptions in
  industrial production. Abundant mineral resources and hydropower have
  formed the basis of industrial development since WWII. Output of the
  extractive industries includes coal, iron ore, magnesite, graphite,
  copper, zinc, lead, and precious metals. Manufacturing is centered on
  heavy industry, including military industry, with light industry
  lagging far behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties,
  expansion of irrigation, and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea
  has not yet become self-sufficient in food production. Six consecutive
  years of poor harvests, coupled with distribution problems, have led
  to chronic food shortages. North Korea remains far behind South Korea
  in economic development and living standards.

@Korea, South, Economy

Overview: 
  The driving force behind the economy's dynamic growth has been the
  planned development of an export-oriented economy in a vigorously
  entrepreneurial society. Real GNP increased more than 10% annually
  between 1986 and 1991. This growth ultimately led to an overheated
  situation characterized by a tight labor market, strong inflationary
  pressures, and a rapidly rising current account deficit. As a result,
  in 1992, economic policy focused on slowing the growth rate of
  inflation and reducing the deficit. Annual growth slowed to 5%, still
  above the rate in most other countries of the world. Growth increased
  to 6.3% in 1993 as a result of fourth quarter manufacturing production
  growth of over 10% and is expected to be in the 8% range for 1994.

@Kyrgyzstan, Economy

Overview: 
  Kyrgyzstan is one of the smallest and poorest states of the former
  Soviet Union. Its economy is heavily agricultural, producing cotton
  and tobacco on irrigated land in the south, grain in the foothills of
  the north, and sheep and goats on mountain pastures. Its small and
  obsolescent industrial sector, concentrated around Bishkek, is heavily
  dependent on Russia and other CIS countries for customers and for
  inputs, including most of its fuel. Since 1990, the economy has
  contracted by almost 40%. Kyrgyzstan's inflation was high in 1993,
  about 23% per month, but rates were declining at the end of the year.
  Kyrgyzstan introduced its national currency, the som, in May 1993, it
  has privatized 28% of its former state assets, and plans call for a
  massive voucher privatization in 1994. Although Kyrgyzstan will
  receive relatively large flows of foreign aid, ongoing economic
  restructuring will continue to be painful with an anticipated increase
  in unemployment as uneconomic enterprises close. President AKAYEV will
  be under strong political pressure to backtrack on some reform
  measures.
National product: 
  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $11.3 billion (1993 estimate from
  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and

  extrapolated to 1993 using official Kirghiz statistics, which are very
  uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)
