The 1994 Edition of the CIA World Factbook

  well-educated population, and a diverse industrial base, continues to
  experience severe difficulties in moving from its old centrally
  planned economy to a modern market economy. President YEL'TSIN's
  government has made some progress toward a market economy by freeing
  most prices, slashing defense spending, unifying foreign exchange
  rates, and launching an ambitious privatization program. Yet much of
  the old order persists and YEL'TSIN faces formidable opposition to
  further measures such as the reduction of subsidies to old-line
  industries. Output continues to fall although the mix is gradually
  becoming more responsive to Russia's needs. According to Russian
  official data, GDP declined by 12% in 1993 compared with 19% in 1992.
  Industrial output in 1993 fell 16% with all major sectors taking a
  hit. Agricultural production, meanwhile, was down 6%. The grain
  harvest totalled 99 million tons - some 8 million tons less than in
  1992. Unemployment climbed in 1993 but remained low by Western
  standards. The official number of unemployed rose from 578,000 at the
  beginning of 1993 to about 1 million - or roughly 1.4% of the work
  force - by yearend. According to the Russian labor minister, the
  actual number of unemployed probably was closer to 4 million.
  Government fears of large-scale unemployment continued to hamper
  industrial restructuring efforts. According to official statistics,
  average real wages remained flat. Nonetheless, a substantial portion
  of the population, particularly the elderly and people in remote
  areas, finds its well-being steadily shrinking. The disparity in
  incomes between the rich and poor continued to rise in 1993, primarily
  reflecting the high earnings of enterprise managers and persons
  employed in the emerging private sector. The government tried to
  narrow the income gap by raising the wages of budget-funded workers -
  mainly teachers and health care specialists. Official data may
  overstate hardships, because many Russians supplement their income by
  moonlighting or by bartering goods and services, activities that often
  go unreported. Russia made good progress on privatization in 1993
  despite active opposition from key cabinet members, hard-line
  legislators, and antireform regional leaders. By yearend, for example,
  roughly 35% of Russia's medium and large state enterprises had been
  auctioned, while the number of private farms in Russia increased by
  86,000, reaching a total of 170,000. As a result, about 6% of
  agricultural land now has been privatized. Financial stabilization
  continued to remain a challenge for the government. Moscow tightened
  financial policies in early 1993 - including postponing planned budget
  spending - and succeeded in reducing monthly inflation from 27% in
  January to 20% in May and June. In the summer, however, the government
  relaxed austerity measures in the face of mounting pressure from
  industry and agriculture, sparking a new round of inflation; the
  monthly inflation rate jumped to 25% in August. In response, Moscow
  announced a package of measures designed to curb government spending
  and inflation. It included eliminating bread subsidies, delaying
  payment obligations, raising interest rates, and phasing out
  concessionary Central Bank credits to enterprises and regions. The
  measures met with some success; the monthly inflation rate declined to
  13% in December. According to official statistics, Russia's 1993 trade
  with nations outside the former Soviet Union produced a $16 billion
  surplus, up from $6 billion in 1992. Moscow arrested the steep drop in
  exports that it had been suffering as a result of ruptured ties with
  former trading partners, output declines, and erratic efforts to move
  to world prices. Foreign sales - comprised largely of oil, natural
  gas, and other raw materials - grew slightly. Imports were down by 15%
  or so as a result of new import taxes and Moscow's reluctance to
  increase its debt burden by purchasing grain and other goods with
  foreign credits. Russian trade with other former Soviet republics
  continued to decline and yielded a surplus of some $5 billion. At the
  same time, Russia paid only a fraction of the roughly $20 billion in
  debt coming due in 1993, and by mid-year, Russia's foreign debt had
  amounted to $81.5 billion. While Moscow reached agreement to
  restructure debts with Paris Club official creditors in April 1993,
  Moscow's refusal to waive its right to sovereign immunity kept Russia
  and its bank creditors from agreeing to restructure Moscow's
  commercial loans. Capital flight continued to be a serious problem in
  1993, with billions of dollars in assets owned by Russians being
  parked abroad at yearend. Russia's capital stock continues to
  deteriorate because of insufficient maintenance and new construction.
  The capital stock on average is twice the age of capital stock in the
  West. Many years will pass before Russia can take full advantage of
  its natural resources and its human assets.

@Rwanda, Economy

Overview: 
  Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural sector; coffee and tea
  make up 80-90% of total exports. The amount of fertile land is
  limited, however, and deforestation and soil erosion have created
  problems. The industrial sector in Rwanda is small, contributing only
  17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of
  agricultural products. The Rwandan economy remains dependent on
  coffee/tea exports and foreign aid. Weak international prices since
  1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to
  decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in
  October 1990. Ethnic-based insurgency in 1990-93 devastated wide areas
  of the north and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. A peace
  accord in mid-1993 temporarily ended most of the fighting, but massive
  resumption of civil warfare in April 1994 in the capital city Kigali
  has been taking thousands of lives and severely damaging short-term
  economic prospects

@Saint Lucia, Economy

Overview: 
  Since 1983 the economy has shown an impressive average annual growth
  rate of almost 5% because of strong agricultural and tourist sectors.
  Saint Lucia also possesses an expanding industrial base supported by
  foreign investment in manufacturing and other activities, such as data
  processing. The economy, however, remains vulnerable because the
  important agricultural sector is dominated by banana production, which
  is subject to periodic droughts and tropical storms. The economy
  exhibited relatively strong growth in 1992-93 based on a recovery of
  the agricultural and manufacturing sectors and continued growth in
  construction and tourism.

@Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Economy

Overview: 
  The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by fishing
  and by servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of
  Newfoundland. The economy has been declining, however, because the
  number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the
  years. In March 1989, an agreement between France and Canada set fish
  quotas for Saint Pierre's trawlers fishing in Canadian and
  Canadian-claimed waters for three years. The agreement settles a
  longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish exports to a
  halt. The islands are heavily subsidized by France. Imports come
  primarily from Canada and France.
