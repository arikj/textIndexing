@Laos, Economy

Overview: 
  Laos has had a Communist centrally planned economy with government
  ownership and control of major productive enterprises. Since 1986,
  however, the government has been decentralizing control and
  encouraging private enterprise. Laos is a landlocked country with a
  primitive infrastructure; it has no railroads, a rudimentary road
  system, limited external and internal telecommunications, and
  electricity available in only a limited area. Subsistence agriculture
  is the main occupation, accounting for over 60% of GDP and providing
  about 85-90% of total employment. The predominant crop is rice. For
  the foreseeable future the economy will continue to depend for its
  survival on foreign aid from the IMF and other international sources;
  aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has been cut sharply.

@Latvia, Economy

Overview: 
  Latvia is rapidly becoming a dynamic market economy, rivaled only by
  Estonia among the former Soviet states in the speed of its
  transformation. The transition has been painful with GDP falling over
  45% in 1992-93, according to official statistics, and industrial
  production experiencing even steeper declines. Nevertheless, the
  government's tough monetary policies and reform program, which foster
  the development of the private sector and market mechanisms, have kept
  inflation low, created a dynamic private sector - much of which is not
  captured in official statistics - and expanded trade ties with the
  West. Much of agriculture is already privatized and the government
  plans to step up the pace of privatization of state enterprises. The
  economy is now poised for recovery and will benefit from the country's
  strategic location on the Baltic Sea, its well-educated population,
  and its diverse - albeit largely obsolete - industrial structure.
National product: 
  GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $13.2 billion (1993 estimate from
  the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and

@Lebanon

Header
Note: 
  Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political institutions
  and regaining its national sovereignty since the end of the
  devastating 16-year civil war in October 1990. Under the Ta'if accord
  - the blueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese have
  established a more equitable political system, particularly by giving
  Muslims a greater say in the political process. Since December 1990,
  the Lebanese have formed three cabinets and conducted the first
  legislative election in 20 years. Most of the militias have been
  weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has seized vast
  quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and extended
  central government authority over about one-half of the country.
  Hizballah, the radical Sh'ia party, retains most of its weapons.
  Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel maintains troops
  in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy militia, The Army
  of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous
  to its border. The ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared
  security zone and about 20 kilometers north to the strategic town of
  Jazzine. As of December 1993, Syria maintained about 30,000-35,000
  troops in Lebanon. These troops are based mainly in Beirut, North
  Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's deployment was legitimized by
  the Arab League early in Lebanon's civil war and in the Ta'if accord.
  Citing the continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests, and
  failure of the Lebanese Government to implement all of the
  constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord, Damascus has so far
  refused to withdraw its troops from Beirut.

@Lebanon, Economy

Overview: 
  Since 1975 civil war has seriously damaged Lebanon's economic
  infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but ended
  Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub.
  Following October 1990, however, a tentative peace has enabled the
  central government to begin restoring control in Beirut, collect
  taxes, and regain access to key port and government facilities. The
  battered economy has also been propped up by a financially sound
  banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers.
  Family remittances, banking transactions, manufactured and farm
  exports, the narcotics trade, and international emergency aid are the
  main sources of foreign exchange. In the relatively settled year of
  1991, industrial production, agricultural output, and exports showed
  substantial gains. The further rebuilding of the war-ravaged country
  was delayed in 1992 because of an upturn in political wrangling. In
  October 1992, Rafiq HARIRI was appointed Prime Minister. HARIRI, a
  wealthy entrepreneur, has announced ambitious plans for Lebanon's
  reconstruction which involve a substantial influx of foreign aid and
  investment. Progress on restoring basic services is limited. Since
  Prime Minister HARIRI's appointment, the most significant improvement
  lies in the stabilization of the Lebanese pound, which had gained over
  30% in value by yearend 1993. The year 1993 was marked by efforts of
  the new administration to encourage domestic and foreign investment
  and to obtain additional international assistance.

@Lesotho, Economy

Overview: 
  Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important natural
  resources other than water. Its economy is based on agriculture, light
  manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed in South Africa
  (recently equal to about 45% of GDP). The great majority of households
  gain their livelihoods from subsistence farming and migrant labor; a
  large portion of the adult male workforce is employed in South African
  mines. Manufacturing depends largely on farm products to support the
  milling, canning, leather, and jute industries; other industries
  include textile, clothing, and construction (in particular, a major
  water improvement project which will permit the sale of water to South
  Africa). Industry's share of GDP rose from 6% in 1982 to 13% in 1991.
National product:

@Liberia, Economy

Overview: 
  Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of Liberia's economy,
  especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Businessmen have
  fled the country, taking capital and expertise with them. Many will
  not return. Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and
  a climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and
  exporter of basic products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign
  owned, had been small in scope. Political instability threatens
  prospects for economic reconstruction and repatriation of some 750,000
  Liberian refugees who have fled to neighboring countries. The

@Libya, Economy

Overview: 
  The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon revenues from
  the oil sector, which contributes practically all export earnings and
  about one-third of GDP. In 1990 per capita GDP was the highest in
  Africa at $5,410, but GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate
  sharply in response to changes in the world oil market. Import
  restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to
  shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs. Windfall revenues from the
  hike in world oil prices in late 1990 improved the foreign payments
  position and resulted in a current account surplus through 1992. The
  nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors, which account for about
  20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products
  to include petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Although
  agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it employs about 20% of the
  labor force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm
  output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food requirements. The UN
  sanctions imposed in April 1992 have not yet had a major impact on the
  economy because Libya's oil revenues generate sufficient foreign
  exchange that, along with Libya's large currency reserves, sustain
  food and consumer goods imports as well as equipment for the oil
  industry and ongoing development projects.
