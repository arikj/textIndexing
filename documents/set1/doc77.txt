@French Guiana, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy is tied closely to that of France through subsidies and
  imports. Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing and
  forestry are the most important economic activities, with exports of
  fish and fish products (mostly shrimp) accounting for more than 60% of
  total revenue in 1992. The large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not
  fully exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry that provides
  sawn logs for export. Cultivation of crops - rice, cassava, bananas,
  and sugar cane - is limited to the coastal area, where the population
  is largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily dependent on imports
  of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious problem, particularly
  among younger workers.

  French Polynesia has changed from a subsistence economy to one in

  20% of GDP and is a primary source of hard currency earnings.

@Gabon, Economy

Overview: 
  Notwithstanding its serious ongoing economic problems, Gabon enjoys a
  per capita income more than twice that of most nations of sub-Saharan
  Africa. Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil was
  discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The oil sector now accounts
  for 50% of GNP. Real growth was feeble in 1992 and Gabon continues to
  face weak prices for its timber, manganese, and uranium exports.
  Despite an abundance of natural wealth, and a manageable rate of
  population growth, the economy is hobbled by poor fiscal management.
  In 1992, the fiscal deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed
  to settled arrears on its bilateral debt, leading to a cancellation of
  rescheduling agreements with official and private creditors.
  Devaluation of the local currency by 50% in January 1994 could set off
  an inflationary spiral if the government fails to reign in spending
  and grants large wage increases to an already overpaid public sector
  workforce.

@The Gambia, Economy

Overview: 
  The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural resources and has
  a limited agricultural base. It is one of the world's poorest
  countries with a per capita income of roughly $800. About 75% of the
  population is engaged in crop production and livestock raising, which
  contribute 30% to GDP. Small-scale manufacturing activity - processing
  peanuts, fish, and hides - accounts for less than 10% of GDP. A
  sustained structural adjustment program, including a liberalized trade
  policy, has fostered a respectable 4% rate of growth in recent years.
  Re-export trade constitutes one-third of economic activity; however,
  border closures associated with Senegal's monetary crisis in late 1993
  led to a 50% decline in re-export trade, reducing government revenues
  in turn. Devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 has made
  Senegalese goods more competitive, and is likely to prompt a
  relaxation of Senegalese controls, paving the way for a comeback in
  re-exports.

Note: 
  The war between Israel and Egypt, Syria, and Jordan in June 1967 ended
  with Israel in control of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza
  Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. Israel withdrew
  from the Sinai Peninsula pursuant to a 1979 peace treaty with Egypt.
  The Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government
  Arrangements ("the DOP"), signed in Washington on 13 September 1993,
  provides for a transitional period not exceeding five years of
  Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West
  Bank. Under the DOP, final status negotiations are to begin no later
  than the beginning of the third year of the transitional period.

Note: 
  Under the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
  Self-Government Arragements ("the DOP"), Israel agreed to transfer
  certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, and
  subsequently to an elected Palestinian Council, as part of interim
  self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A
  transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho
  has taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement
  on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area. The DOP provides that Israel
  will retain responsibility during the transitional period for external
  security and for internal security and public order of settlements and
  Israelis. Final status is to be determined through direct negotiations
  within five years.

@Gaza Strip, Economy

Overview: 
  In 1991 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed across the
  border by Israeli industrial, construction, and agricultural
  enterprises, with worker remittances accounting for about one-third of
  GNP. The construction, agricultural, and industrial sectors account
  for about 18%, 16%, and 12% of GNP, respectively. Gaza depends upon
  Israel for nearly 90% of its external trade. Aggravating the impact of
  Israeli military administration, unrest in the territory since 1988
  (intifadah) has raised unemployment and lowered the standard of living
  of Gazans. The Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt
  blows to Gaza since August 1990. Worker remittances from the Gulf
  states have dropped, unemployment has increased, and exports have
  fallen. The withdrawal of Israel from the Gaza Strip in May 1994
  brings a new set of adjustment problems.

@Georgia, Economy

Overview: 
  Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved around Black Sea tourism;
  cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and grapes; mining of manganese and
  copper; and a small industrial sector producing wine, metals,
  machinery, chemicals, and textiles. The country imports the bulk of
  its energy needs, including natural gas and coal. Its only sizable
  domestic energy resource is hydropower. Since 1990, widespread
  conflicts, e.g., in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Mengrelia, severely
  aggravated the economic crisis resulting from the disintegration of
  the Soviet command economy in December 1991. Throughout 1993, much of
  industry was functioning at only 20% of capacity; heavy disruptions in
  agricultural cultivation were reported; and tourism was shut down. The
  country is precariously dependent on US and EU humanitarian grain
  shipments, as most other foods are priced beyond reach of the average
  citizen. Georgia is also suffering from an acute energy crisis, as it
  is having problems paying for even minimal imports. Georgia is pinning
  its hopes for recovery on reestablishing trade ties with Russia and on
  developing international transportation through the key Black Sea
  ports of P'ot'i and Bat'umi.
