@Kyrgyzstan:Economy

 Overview: Kyrgyzstan is one of the smallest and poorest states of the
 former Soviet Union. Its economy is heavily agricultural, growing
 cotton and tobacco on irrigated land in the south and grain in the
 foothills of the north and raising sheep and goats on mountain
 pastures. Its small and obsolescent industrial sector, concentrated
 around Bishkek, has traditionally relied on Russia and other CIS
 countries for customers and industrial inputs, including most of its
 fuel. Since 1990, the economy has contracted by almost 50% as
 subsidies from Moscow vanished and trade links with other former
 Soviet republics eroded. At the same time, the Kyrgyz government stuck
 to tight monetary and fiscal policies in 1994 that succeeded in
 reducing inflation from 23% per month in 1993 to 5.4% per month in
 1994. Moreover, Kyrgyzstan has been the most successful of the Central
 Asian states in reducing state controls over the economy and
 privatizing state industries. Nevertheless, restructuring proved to be
 a slow and painful process in 1994 despite relatively large flows of
 foreign aid and continued progress on economic reform. The decline in
 output in 1995 may be much smaller, perhaps 5%, compared with an
 estimated 24% in 1994.

@Laos:Economy

 Overview: The government of Laos - one of the few remaining official
 Communist states - has been decentralizing control and encouraging
 private enterprise since 1986. The results, starting from an extremely
 low base, have been striking - growth has averaged 7.5% annually since
 1988. Even so, Laos is a landlocked country with a primitive
 infrastructure. It has no railroads, a rudimentary road system, and
 limited external and internal telecommunications. Electricity is
 available in only a few urban areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts
 for half of GDP and provides 80% of total employment. The predominant
 crop is rice. In non-drought years, Laos is self-sufficient overall in
 food, but each year flood, pests, and localized drought cause
 shortages in various parts of the country. For the foreseeable future
 the economy will continue to depend on aid from the IMF and other
 international sources; aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has
 been cut sharply. As in many developing countries, deforestation and
 soil erosion will hamper efforts to maintain the high rate of GDP
 growth.

@Latvia:Economy

 Overview: Latvia is rapidly becoming a dynamic market economy, rivaled
 only by Estonia among the former Soviet states in the speed of its
 transformation. However, the transition has been painful; in 1994 the
 IMF reported a 2% growth in GDP, following steep declines in 1992-93.
 The government's tough monetary policies and reform program have kept
 inflation at less than 2% a month, supported a dynamic private sector
 now accounting for more than half of GDP, and spurred the growth of
 trade ties with the West. Much of agriculture is already privatized
 and the government plans to step up the pace of privatization of state
 enterprises. Latvia thus is in the midst of recovery, helped by the
 country's strategic location on the Baltic Sea, its well-educated
 population, and its diverse - albeit largely obsolete - industrial
 structure.

LEBANON

 Note--Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political
 institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since the end of
 the devastating 16-year civil war which began in 1975. Under the Ta'if
 accord - the blueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese have
 established a more equitable political system, particularly by giving
 Muslims a greater say in the political process. Since December 1990,
 the Lebanese have formed three cabinets and conducted the first
 legislative election in 20 years. Most of the militias have been
 weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has seized vast
 quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and extended
 central government authority over about one-half of the country.
 Hizballah, the radical Sh'ia party, retains most of its weapons.
 Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel maintains troops
 in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy militia, The Army
 of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous
 to its border. The ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared
 security zone and about 20 kilometers north to the strategic town of
 Jazzine. As of December 1993, Syria maintained about 30,000-35,000
 troops in Lebanon. These troops are based mainly in Beirut, North
 Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's deployment was legitimized by
 the Arab League early in Lebanon's civil war and in the Ta'if accord.
 Citing the continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests, and
 failure of the Lebanese Government to implement all of the
 constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord, Damascus has so far
 refused to withdraw its troops from Beirut.

@Lebanon:Economy

 Overview: The 1975-1991 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's economic
 infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but ended
 Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub. A
 tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin restoring
 control in Beirut, collect taxes, and regain access to key port and
 government facilities. The battered economy has also been propped up
 by a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and
 medium-scale manufacturers. Family remittances, banking transactions,
 manufactured and farm exports, the narcotics trade, and international
 emergency aid are the main sources of foreign exchange. In the
 relatively settled year of 1991, industrial production, agricultural
 output, and exports showed substantial gains. The further rebuilding
 of the war-ravaged country was delayed in 1992 because of an upturn in
 political wrangling. In October 1992, Rafiq HARIRI was appointed Prime
 Minister. HARIRI, a wealthy entrepreneur, announced ambitious plans
 for Lebanon's reconstruction which involve a substantial influx of
 foreign aid and investment. Progress on restoring basic services is
 limited. Since Prime Minister HARIRI's appointment, the most
 significant improvement lies in the stabilization of the Lebanese
 pound, which had gained over 30% in value by yearend 1993. The years
 1993 and 1994 were marked by efforts of the new administration to
 encourage domestic and foreign investment and to obtain additional
 international assistance. The construction sector led the 8.5% advance
 in real GDP in 1994.

@Lesotho:Economy

 Overview: Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important
 natural resources other than water. Its economy is based on
 agriculture, light manufacturing, and remittances from laborers
 employed in South Africa (these remittances supplement domestic income
 by as much as 45%). The great majority of households gain their
 livelihoods from subsistence farming and migrant labor; a large
 portion of the adult male work force is employed in South African
 mines. Manufacturing depends largely on farm products to support the
 milling, canning, leather, and jute industries; other industries
 include textile, clothing, and construction. Although drought has
 decreased agricultural activity over the past few years, improvement
 of a major hydropower facility will permit the sale of water to South
 Africa and allow Lesotho's economy to continue its moderate growth.

@Liberia:Economy

 Overview: Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of Liberia's
 economy, especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia.
 Businessmen have fled the country, taking capital and expertise with
 them. Many will not return. Richly endowed with water, mineral
 resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia
 had been a producer and exporter of basic products, while local
 manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope.
 Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction
 and repatriation of some 750,000 Liberian refugees who have fled to
 neighboring countries. The political impasse between the interim
 government and rebel leader Charles TAYLOR has prevented restoration
 of normal economic life, including the re-establishment of a strong
 central government with effective economic development programs. The
 economy deteriorated further in 1994.
