@Denmark:Economy

 Overview: This thoroughly modern economy features high-tech
 agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and corporate industry, extensive
 government welfare measures, comfortable living standards, and high
 dependence on foreign trade. Denmark is self-sufficient in food
 production. The new center-left coalition government will concentrate
 on reducing the persistent high unemployment rate and the budget
 deficit as well as following the previous government's policies of
 maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. In the face
 of recent international market pressure on the Danish krone, the
 coalition has also vowed to maintain a stable currency. The coalition
 hopes to lower marginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax
 revenues; boost industrial competitiveness through labor market and
 tax reforms and increased research and development funds; and improve
 welfare services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays.
 Prime Minister RASMUSSEN's reforms will focus on adapting Denmark to
 the criteria for European integration by 1999; although Copenhagen has
 won from the European Union (EU) the right to opt out of the European
 Monetary Union (EMU) if a national referendum rejects it. Denmark is,
 in fact, one of the few EU countries likely to fit into the EMU on
 time. Denmark is weathering the current worldwide slump better than
 many West European countries. After posting 4.5% real GDP growth in
 1994, Copenhagen is predicting a continued strong showing in 1995,
 with real GDP up by 3.2%. The government expects an upswing in
 business investment in 1995 to drive economic growth. Although
 unemployment is high, it remains stable compared to most European
 countries.

@Djibouti:Economy

 Overview: The economy is based on service activities connected with
 the country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in
 northeast Africa. Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital
 city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders. Scanty rainfall
 limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most food must be
 imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the
 region and an international transshipment and refueling center. It has
 few natural resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore,
 heavily dependent on foreign assistance (an important supplement to
 GDP) to help support its balance of payments and to finance
 development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be
 a major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over
 the last six years because of recession, civil war, and a high
 population growth rate (including immigrants and refugees).

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $500 million (1994

 petroleum products

@Dominica:Economy

 Overview: The economy is dependent on agriculture and thus is highly
 vulnerable to climatic conditions. Agriculture accounts for about 30%
 of GDP and employs 40% of the labor force. Principal products include
 bananas, citrus, mangoes, root crops, and coconuts. Development of the
 tourist industry remains difficult because of the rugged coastline and
 the lack of an international airport. In 1994 a tropical storm
 devastated the banana industry.

@Dominican Republic:Economy

 Overview: The Dominican economy showed some signs of slippage in 1994,
 although its overall performance in recent years has been relatively
 strong. After posting an increase of nearly 8% in 1992, GDP growth
 fell to 3% in 1993 and 1994 as mining output decreased and erosion of
 real wages caused private consumption to decline. A pre-election boost
 in government spending in early 1994 led to the first government
 deficit in four years and bumped inflation up to 14% for the year.
 Continued dynamism in construction and the services sector, especially
 tourism, should keep the economy growing in 1995. Tourism,
 agriculture, and manufacturing for export remain key sectors of the
 economy. Domestic industry is based on the processing of agricultural
 products, oil refining, and chemicals.

 Overview: Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural
 areas. Growth has been uneven in recent years because of fluctuations
 in prices for Ecuador's primary exports - oil and bananas - as well as
 because of government policies designed to curb inflation. President
 Sixto DURAN-BALLEN launched a series of macroeconomic reforms when he
 came into office in August 1992 which included raising domestic fuel
 prices and utility rates, eliminating most subsidies, and bringing the
 government budget into balance. These measures helped to reduce
 inflation from 55% in 1992 to 25% in 1994. DURAN-BALLEN has a much
 more favorable attitude toward foreign investment than his predecessor
 and has supported several laws designed to encourage foreign
 investment. Ecuador has implemented free or complementary trade
 agreements with Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, as well
 as applied for World Trade Organization membership. Ecuador signed a
 standby agreement with the IMF and rescheduled its $7.6 billion
 commercial debt in 1994 thereby regaining access to multilateral
 lending. Growth in 1994 speeded up to 3.9%, based on increased exports
 of bananas and non-traditional products, while international reserves
 increased to a record $1.6 billion.

@Egypt:Economy

 Overview: Half of Egypt's GDP originates in the public sector, most
 industrial plants being owned by the government. Overregulation holds
 back technical modernization and foreign investment. Even so, the
 economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but in
 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden
 of debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
 balance-of-payments support. Egypt's first IMF standby arrangement
 concluded in mid-1987 was suspended in early 1988 because of the
 government's failure to adopt promised reforms. Egypt signed a
 follow-on program with the IMF and also negotiated a structural
 adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991. In 1991-93 the government
 made solid progress on administrative reforms such as liberalizing
 exchange and interest rates but resisted implementing major structural
 reforms like streamlining the public sector. As a result, the economy
 has not gained momentum and unemployment has become a growing problem.
 Egypt probably will continue making uneven progress in implementing
 the successor programs with the IMF and World Bank it signed onto in
 late 1993. Tourism has plunged since 1992 because of sporadic attacks
 by Islamic extremists on tourist groups. President MUBARAK has cited
 population growth as the main cause of the country's economic
 troubles. The addition of about 1.2 million people a year to the
 already huge population of 62 million exerts enormous pressure on the
 5% of the land area available for agriculture along the Nile.
