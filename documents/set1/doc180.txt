Economy

Economy - overview: A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls,
Kiribati has few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate
deposits were exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and
fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has
fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP growth has declined from
about 10% in 1988 to about 2.6% in 1995. Economic development is
constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak infrastructure, and
remoteness from international markets. The financial sector is at an
early stage of development. Foreign financial aid, largely from the UK
and Japan, is a critical supplement to GDP, equal in amount to 25%-50%
of GDP in recent years. Remittances from overseas I-Kiribati account
for more than $5 million each year.

Economy

Economy - overview: More than 90% of this command economy is
socialized; agricultural land is collectivized; and state-owned
industry produces 95% of manufactured goods. State control of economic
affairs is unusually tight even for a communist country because of the
small size and homogeneity of the society and the strict rule of KIM
Il-song in the past and now his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth
during the period 1984-88 averaged 2%-3%, but output declined by an
average of 4%-5% annually during 1989-96 because of systemic problems
and disruptions in socialist-style economic relations and
technological links with the former USSR and China. The leadership has
insisted on maintaining its high level of military outlays from a
shrinking economic pie. Moreover, a serious drawdown in inventories
and critical shortages in the energy sector have led to increasing
interruptions in industrial production. Abundant mineral resources and
hydropower have formed the basis of industrial development since World
War II. Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry, including
military industry, with light industry lagging far behind. Despite the
use of improved seed varieties, expansion of irrigation, and the heavy
use of fertilizers, North Korea has not yet become self-sufficient in
food production. Indeed, a shortage of arable lands, several years of
poor harvests, systemic inefficiencies, a cumbersome distribution
system, and extensive floods in 1995-96 have resulted in recurring
food shortages. Substantial grain shipments from Japan and South Korea
are offsetting a portion of the losses. North Korea remains far behind
South Korea in economic development and living standards.

Economy

Economy - overview: As one of the Four Dragons of East Asia, South
Korea has achieved an incredible record of growth. Three decades ago
its GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries
of Africa and Asia. Today its GDP per capita is eight times India's,
15 times North Korea's, and already up with the lesser economies of
the European Union. This success has been achieved by a unique system
of guidance by an authoritarian government of what is essentially an
entrepreneurial process. The government has sponsored large-scale
adoption of technology and management from Japan and other modern
nations; has successfully pushed the development of export industries
while encouraging the import of machinery and materials at the expense
of consumer goods; and has pushed its labor force to a work effort
seldom matched anywhere even in wartime. Real GDP grew by an average
10% in 1986-91, then paused to a "mere" 5% in 1992-93, moved back up
to 8% in 1994 and 9% in 1995, and about 7% in 1996. With a much higher
standard of living and with a considerable easing of authoritarian
controls, the work pace has softened. Growth rates will probably slow
down over the medium term.

Economy

Economy - overview: Kuwait is a small and relatively open economy with
proved crude oil reserves of about 94 billion barrels - 10% of world
reserves. Kuwait has rebuilt its war-ravaged petroleum sector; its
crude oil production averaged 2 million barrels per day in 1996.
Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 90% of export revenues, and
75% of government income. Kuwait lacks water and has practically no
arable land, thus preventing development of agriculture. With the
exception of fish, it depends almost wholly on food imports. About 75%
of potable water must be distilled or imported. Because of its high
per capita income, comparable with Western European incomes, Kuwait
provides its citizens with extensive health, educational, and
retirement benefits. The bulk of the work force is non-Kuwaiti, living
at a considerably lower level. Per capita military expenditures are
among the highest in the world. The economy improved moderately in
1994-96, with the growth in industry and finance. The World Bank has
urged Kuwait to push ahead with privatization, including in the oil
industry, but the government will move slowly on opening the petroleum
sector.

Economy

Economy - overview: Kyrgyzstan is a small, poor, mountainous country
with a predominantly agricultural economy. Cotton, wool, and meat are
the main agricultural products and exports. Industrial exports
included gold, mercury, uranium, and hydropower. Kyrgyzstan has been
one of the most progressive countries of the former Soviet Union in
carrying out market reforms. Following a successful stabilization
program, which lowered inflation from 88% in 1994 to 32% for 1996,
attention is turning toward stimulating growth. Much of the
government's stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops in production
have been severe since the break up of the Soviet Union in December
1991, but by mid-1995 production began to recover and exports began to
increase. Pensioners, unemployed workers, and government workers with
salaries arrears continue to suffer. Foreign assistance plays a
substantial role in the country's budget. In 1996 the economy showed
strong signs that recovery was underway.
