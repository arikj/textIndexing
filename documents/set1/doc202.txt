Economy

Economy - overview: Vietnam is a poor, densely populated country that
has had to recover from the ravages of war, the loss of financial
support from the old Soviet Bloc, and the rigidities of a centrally
planned economy. Substantial progress has been achieved over the past
10 years in moving forward from an extremely low starting point.
Economic growth continued at a strong pace during 1996 with industrial
output rising by 14% and real GDP expanding by 9.4%. Foreign direct
investment rose to an estimated $2.3 billion for the year, up by about
30% from 1995. These positive numbers, however, masked some major
difficulties that are emerging in economic performance. Many domestic
industries, including coal, cement, steel, and paper, reported large
stockpiles of inventory and tough competition from more efficient
foreign producers. Vietnam's trade deficit widened to $4 billion in
1996, up over 80% from a year ago. While disbursements of aid and
foreign direct investment have risen, they are not large enough to
finance the rapid increase in imports and it is widely believed that
Vietnam may be using short-term trade credits to bridge the gap - a
risky strategy that could result in a foreign exchange crunch during
1997. Meanwhile, Vietnamese authorities continue to move very slowly
toward implementing the structural reforms needed to revitalize the
economy and produce more competitive, export-driven industries.
Privatization of state enterprises remains bogged down in political
controversy, while the country's dynamic private sector is denied both
financing and access to markets. Reform of the banking sector is
proceeding slowly, raising concerns that the country will be unable to
tap sufficient domestic savings to maintain current high levels of
growth. Administrative and legal barriers are also causing costly
delays for foreign investors and are raising similar doubts about
Vietnam's ability to maintain the inflow of foreign capital.
Ideological bias in favor of state intervention and control of the
economy is slowing progress toward a more liberalized investment
environment.

to all provinces; the density of telephone receivers nationwide
doubled from 1993 to 1995, but is still far behind other countries in
the region; Vietnam's telecommunications strategy aims to increase

telecommunications upgrades through the end of the decade

Economy

Economy - overview: Tourism is the primary economic activity,
accounting for more than 70% of GDP and 70% of employment. The number
of US tourists in the first five months of 1996 was down by 55% from
the same period in 1995, the lingering result of the fierce hurricanes
of 1995. Unemployment rose sharply in 1996. The manufacturing sector
consists of textile, electronics, pharmaceutical, and watch assembly
plants. The agricultural sector is small, most food being imported.
International business and financial services are a small but growing
component of the economy. One of the world's largest petroleum
refineries is at Saint Croix. A major economic problem at the
beginning of 1997 was the more than $1 billion in governmental
arrears, in income tax refunds, payments to vendors, and overdue
wages.

rights to Japan and South Korea, import taxes, and remittances from
expatriate workers in New Caledonia. Wallis and Futuna imports food -
particularly sugar, rice, and beef - fuel, clothing, machinery, and
transport equipment, but its exports are negligible, consisting of
copra and handicrafts.

WEST BANK

Introduction

Current issues: The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements ("the DOP"), signed in Washington on 13
September 1993, provides for a transitional period not exceeding five
years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank. Permanent status negotiations began on 5 May 1996. Under
the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and responsibilities
to the Palestinian Authority, which includes a Palestinian Legislative
Council elected in January 1996, as part of interim self-governing
arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and
responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho has taken place
pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza
Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional areas of the West Bank
pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement. The
DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the
transitional period for external security and for internal security
and public order of settlements and Israelis. Permanent status is to
be determined through direct negotiations which began on 5 May 1996.

Economy

Economy - overview: Economic progress in the West Bank has been
hampered by tight Israeli security restrictions. Industries using
advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have been
discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli
policies. Capital investment consists largely of residential housing,
not productive assets that would enable local Palestinian firms to
compete with Israeli industry. GDP has been substantially supplemented
by remittances of workers employed in Israel. Such transfers from the
Persian Gulf states dropped after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
In the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have
returned to the West Bank, increasing unemployment, and export
revenues have dropped because of the decline of markets in Jordan and
the Gulf states. An estimated 147,000 people were in refugee camps in
1996.
