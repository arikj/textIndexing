@Papua New Guinea, Economy

Overview: 
  Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but
  exploitation has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high cost
  of developing an infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence
  livelihood for 85% of the population. Mining of numerous deposits,
  including copper and gold, accounts for about 60% of export earnings.
  Budgetary support from Australia and development aid under World Bank
  auspices have helped sustain the economy. Robust growth in 1991-92 was
  led by the mining sector; the opening of a large new gold mine helped
  the advance. The economy remained strong in 1993, primarily because of
  continued growth in the mining and oil sectors.

@Paraguay, Economy

Overview: 
  Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25% of GDP,
  employs about 45% of the labor force, and provides the bulk of
  exports, led by soybeans and cotton. Paraguay lacks substantial
  mineral or petroleum resources but possesses a large hydropower
  potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared with
  the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an average annual
  rate of nearly 11%. During the period 1982-86 real GDP fell in three
  of five years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and foreign
  debt rose. Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy
  were the completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for
  crops, and weak export prices for agricultural commodities. In 1987
  the economy experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather
  conditions and stronger international prices for key agricultural
  exports. The recovery continued through 1990, on the strength of
  bumper crops in 1988-89. In a major step to increase its economic
  activity in the region, Paraguay in March 1991 joined the Southern
  Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes Brazil, Argentina, and
  Uruguay. In 1992, the government, through an unorthodox approach,
  reduced external debt with both commercial and official creditors by
  purchasing a sizable amount of the delinquent commercial debt in the
  secondary market at a substantial discount. The government had paid
  100% of remaining official debt arrears to the US, Germany, France,
  and Spain. All commercial debt arrears have been rescheduled. For the
  long run, the government must press forward with general,
  market-oriented economic reforms. Growth of 3.5% in 1993 was spurred
  by higher-than-expected agricultural output and rising international
  commodity prices. Inflation picked up steam in fourth quarter 1993
  because of rises in public sector salaries and utility rates.

note: 
  the 1979 Constitution and legislation enacted from 1987 to 1990
  mandate the creation of regions (regiones, singular - region) intended
  to function eventually as autonomous economic and administrative
  entities; so far, 12 regions have been constituted from 23 existing
  departments - Amazonas (from Loreto), Andres Avelino Caceres (from
  Huanuco, Pasco, Junin), Arequipa (from Arequipa), Chavin (from
  Ancash), Grau (from Tumbes, Piura), Inca (from Cusco, Madre de Dios,
  Apurimac), La Libertad (from La Libertad), Los Libertadores-Huari
  (from Ica, Ayacucho, Huancavelica), Mariategui (from Moquegua, Tacna,
  Puno), Nor Oriental del Maranon (from Lambayeque, Cajamarca,
  Amazonas), San Martin (from San Martin), Ucayali (from Ucayali);
  formation of another region has been delayed by the reluctance of the
  constitutional province of Callao to merge with the department of
  Lima. Because of inadequate funding from the central government and
  organizational and political difficulties, the regions have yet to
  assume major responsibilities. The 1993 Constitution maintains the
  regionalization process with some modifications that will limit the
  powers of the regional governments. The new constitution also
  reaffirms the roles of departmental and municipal governments.

@Peru, Economy

Overview: 
  The Peruvian economy is becoming increasingly market oriented, with
  major privatizations scheduled for 1994 in the mining and
  telecommunications industries. In the 1980s the economy suffered from
  hyperinflation, declining per capita output, and mounting external
  debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World Bank support in the
  mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An austerity program
  implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took office in July
  1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic
  activity, but the slide halted late that year, and output rose 2.4% in
  1991. After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated
  government price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the
  single-digit level and by December 1991 dropped to the lowest increase
  since mid-1987. Lima obtained a financial rescue package from
  multilateral lenders in September 1991, although it faced $14 billion
  in arrears on its external debt. By working with the IMF and World
  Bank on new financial conditions and arrangements, the government
  succeeded in ending its arrears by March 1993. In 1992, GDP fell by
  2.8%, in part because a warmer-than-usual El Nino current resulted in
  a 30% drop in the fish catch. In 1993 the economy rebounded as strong
  foreign investment helped push growth to 6%.

@Philippines, Economy

Overview: 
  Domestic output in this primarily agricultural economy failed to grow
  in 1992 and rose only slightly in 1993. Drought and power supply
  problems hampered production, while inadequate revenues prevented
  government pump priming. Worker remittances helped to supplement GDP.
  A marked increase in capital goods imports, particularly power
  generating equipment, telecommunications equipment, and electronic
  data processors, contributed to 20% import growth in both 1992 and
  1993.

  including citrus, sugar cane, watermelons, bananas, yams, and beans.
  Bartering is an important part of the economy. The major sources of

@Poland, Economy

Overview: 
  Poland is continuing the difficult transition to a market economy that
  began on 1 January 1990, when the new democratic government instituted
  "shock therapy" by decontrolling prices, slashing subsidies, and
  drastically reducing import barriers. The economy contracted sharply
  in 1990 and 1991, but in 1992 real GDP grew 1% despite a severe
  drought. Real GDP expanded about 4% in 1993, the highest rate in
  Europe except for Albania. About half of GDP now comes from the
  private sector even though privatization of the large state-owned
  enterprises is proceeding slowly and most industry remains in state
  hands. The pattern of industrial production is changing rapidly;
  output of textiles and construction materials is well above 1990
  levels, while output of basic metals remains depressed. Inflation,
  which had exceeded 50% monthly in late 1989, was down to about 37% for
  all of 1993, as the government held the budget deficit below 3% of
  GDP. Unemployment has risen steadily, however, to about 16%. The trade
  deficit is also a problem, in part due to recession in Western Europe,
  Poland's main customer. The new government elected in September 1993
  is politically to the left of its predecessor but is continuing the
  reform process.
