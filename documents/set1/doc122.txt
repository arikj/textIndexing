@Faroe Islands:Economy

 Overview: The Faroese, who have long enjoyed the affluent living
 standards of the Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the
 decline of the all-important fishing industry and one of the world's
 heaviest per capita external debts of about $25,000. When the nations
 of the world extended their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the
 early 1970s, the Faroese no longer could continue their traditional
 long-distance fishing and subsequently depleted their own nearby
 fishing areas. The government's tight controls on fish stocks and its
 austerity measures have caused a recession, and subsidy cuts will
 force nationalization in the fishing industry, which has already been
 plagued with bankruptcies. Copenhagen has threatened to withhold its
 annual subsidy of $130 million - roughly one-third of the islands'
 budget revenues - unless the Faroese make significant efforts to
 balance their budget. To this extent the Faroe government is expected
 to continue its tough policies, including introducing a 20%
 value-added tax (VAT) in 1993, and has agreed to an IMF
 economic-political stabilization plan. In addition to its annual
 subsidy, the Danish government has bailed out the second largest Faroe
 bank to the tune of $140 million since October 1992.

@Fiji:Economy

 Overview: Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large
 subsistence sector. Sugar exports and tourism are the major sources of
 foreign exchange. Industry contributes 13% to GDP, with sugar
 processing accounting for one-third of industrial activity. Roughly
 250,000 tourists visit each year. Political uncertainty and drought,
 however, contribute to substantial fluctuations in earnings from
 tourism and sugar and to the emigration of skilled workers. In 1992,
 growth was approximately 3%, based on growth in tourism and a
 lessening of labor-management disputes in the sugar and gold-mining
 sectors. In 1993, the government's budgeted growth rate of 3% was not
 achieved because of a decline in non-sugar agricultural output and
 damage from Cyclone Kina. Growth in 1994 is estimated to be 5%,
 largely attributed to increased tourism and expansion in domestic
 production, particularly in the manufacturing sector.

@Finland:Economy

 Overview: Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free market
 economy, with per capita output two-thirds of the US figure. Its key
 economic sector is manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, and
 engineering industries. Trade is important, with the export of goods
 representing about 30% of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals,
 Finland depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some
 components for manufactured goods. Because of the climate,
 agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in
 basic products. Forestry, an important export earner, provides a
 secondary occupation for the rural population. The economy, which
 experienced an average of 4.9% annual growth between 1987 and 1989,
 sank into deep recession in 1991 as GDP contracted by 6.5%. The
 recession - which continued in 1992 with GDP contracting by 4.1% - has
 been caused by economic overheating, depressed foreign markets, and
 the dismantling of the barter system between Finland and the former
 Soviet Union under which Soviet oil and gas had been exchanged for
 Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish Government has proposed
 efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and efficiency by an
 increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in public expenditures,
 partial privatization of state enterprises, and changes in monetary
 policy. In June 1991 Helsinki had tied the markka to the European
 Union's (EU) European Currency Unit (ECU) to promote stability.
 Ongoing speculation resulting from a lack of confidence in the
 government's policies forced Helsinki to devalue the markka by about
 12% in November 1991 and to indefinitely break the link in September
 1992. The devaluations have boosted the competitiveness of Finnish
 exports. The recession bottomed out in 1993, and Finland participated
 in the general European upturn of 1994. Unemployment probably will
 remain a serious problem during the next few years; the majority of
 Finnish firms face a weak domestic market and the troubled German and
 Swedish export markets. The Finns voted in an October 1994 referendum
 to enter the EU, and Finland officially joined the Union on 1 January
 1995. Increasing integration with Western Europe will dominate the
 economic picture over the next few years.

@France:Economy

 Overview: One of the world's most highly developed economies, France
 has substantial agricultural resources and a diversified modern
 industrial sector. Large tracts of fertile land, the application of
 modern technology, and subsidies have combined to make it the leading
 agricultural producer in Western Europe. Largely self-sufficient in
 agricultural products, France is a major exporter of wheat and dairy
 products. The industrial sector generates about one-quarter of GDP,
 and the growing services sector has become crucial to the economy.
 Following stagnation and recession in 1991-93, French GDP in 1994
 expanded 2.4%. Growth in 1995 is expected to be in the 3.0% to 3.5%
 range. Persistently high unemployment will still pose a major problem
 for the government. Paris remains committed to maintaining the
 franc-deutsche mark parity, which has kept French interest rates high
 despite France's low inflation. Although the pace of economic and
 financial integration within the European Union has slowed down,
 integration presumably will remain a major force shaping the fortunes
 of the various economic sectors over the next few years.

@French Guiana:Economy

 Overview: The economy is tied closely to that of France through
 subsidies and imports. Besides the French space center at Kourou,
 fishing and forestry are the most important economic activities, with
 exports of fish and fish products (mostly shrimp) accounting for more
 than 60% of total revenue in 1992. The large reserves of tropical
 hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry
 that provides sawn logs for export. Cultivation of crops - rice,
 cassava, bananas, and sugarcane - is limited to the coastal area,
 where the population is largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily
 dependent on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious
 problem, particularly among younger workers.
