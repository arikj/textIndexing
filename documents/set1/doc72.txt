@China, Economy

Overview: 
  Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been trying to move
  the economy from the sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned economy
  to a more productive and flexible economy with market elements, but
  still within the framework of monolithic Communist control. To this
  end the authorities switched to a system of household responsibility
  in agriculture in place of the old collectivization, increased the
  authority of local officials and plant managers in industry, permitted
  a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services and light
  manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased foreign trade and
  investment. The result has been a strong surge in production,
  particularly in agriculture in the early 1980s. Industry also has
  posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and
  opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and modern production
  methods have helped spur production of both domestic and export goods.
  Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On the darker side,
  the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the worst
  results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of
  capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has
  periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at intervals.
  In 1992-93 annual growth of GDP has accelerated, particularly in the
  coastal areas - to more than 10% annually according to official
  claims. In late 1993 China's leadership approved additional reforms
  aimed at giving more play to market-oriented institutions and at
  strengthening the center's control over the financial system. Popular
  resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural
  cadres have weakened China's population control program, which is
  essential to the nation's long-term economic viability.

@Colombia, Economy

Overview: 
  Colombia's economic growth has recovered steadily since 1991 as
  President GAVIRIA'S sweeping economic reform measures have taken hold.
  Market reforms have included trade and investment liberalization,
  labor and tax overhauls and bureaucratic streamlining, among other
  things. Furthermore, conservative fiscal and monetary policies have
  helped to steadily reduce inflation to 23% and unemployment to about
  7% in 1993. The rapid development of oil, coal, and other
  nontraditional industries has helped offset the decline in coffee
  prices. A major oil find in 1993 in eastern Colombia may provide an
  extra $3 billion annually to the economy by 1997. Increased foreign
  investment and even greater domestic activity have been hampered,
  however, by a troublesome rural insurgency, a decrepit energy and
  transportation infrastructure, and drug-related violence. Agriculture
  also has encountered problems in adjusting to fewer subsidies, greater
  competition, and the collapse of the international coffee agreement,
  which has kept world coffee prices at near-record lows in 1991-93.
  Business construction was a leading sector in 1993. The substantial
  trade deficit in 1993 was the result of a strong peso that inhibited
  exports and a liberalized government policy that spurred imports.

@Comoros, Economy

Overview: 
  One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of several
  islands that have poor transportation links, a young and rapidly
  increasing population, and few natural resources. The low educational
  level of the labor force contributes to a low level of economic
  activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants
  and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and
  forestry, is the leading sector of the economy. It contributes 40% to
  GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports.
  The country is not self-sufficient in food production, and rice, the
  main staple, accounts for 90% of imports. During 1982-86 the
  industrial sector grew at an annual average rate of 5.3%, but its
  contribution to GDP is small. Despite major investment in the tourist
  industry, which accounts for about 25% of GDP, growth has stagnated
  since 1983. A sluggish growth rate of 1.5% during 1985-90 has led to
  large budget deficits, declining incomes, and balance-of-payments
  difficulties. Estimates for 1992 show a moderate increase in the
  growth rate based on increased exports, tourism, and government
  investment outlays.

@Congo, Economy

Overview: 
  Congo's economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts,
  an industrial sector based largely on oil, support services, and a
  government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. A reform
  program, supported by the IMF and World Bank, ran into difficulties in
  1990-91 because of problems in changing to a democratic political
  regime and a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has supplanted forestry
  as the mainstay of the economy, providing about two-thirds of
  government revenues and exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil
  revenues enabled Congo to finance large-scale development projects
  with growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest rates in Africa.
  Subsequently, growth has slowed to an average of roughly 1.5%
  annually, only half the population growth rate. Political turmoil and
  misguided government investment have derailed economic reform programs
  sponsored by the IMF and World Bank.
