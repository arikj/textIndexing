@Equatorial Guinea:Economy

 Overview: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing account for about half of
 GDP and nearly all exports. Subsistence farming predominates. Although
 pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for
 hard currency earnings, the deterioration of the rural economy under
 successive brutal regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led
 growth. A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the
 international donor community have failed to revitalize export
 agriculture. Businesses for the most part are owned by government
 officials and their family members. Commerce accounts for about 8% of
 GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors for about
 38%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore,
 manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil exploration, taking place
 under concessions offered to US, French, and Spanish firms, has been
 moderately successful. Increased production from recently discovered
 natural gas fields will provide a greater share of exports in 1995.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $280 million (1993
 est.)

 National product real growth rate: 7.3% (1993 est.)

@Eritrea:Economy

 Overview: With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993, Eritrea
 faces the bitter economic problems of a small, desperately poor
 African country. Most of the population will continue to depend on
 subsistence farming. Domestic output is substantially augmented by
 worker remittances from abroad. Government revenues come from custom
 duties and income and sales taxes. Eritrea has inherited the entire
 coastline of Ethiopia and has long-term prospects for revenues from
 the development of offshore oil, offshore fishing, and tourism. For
 the time being, Ethiopia will be largely dependent on Eritrean ports
 for its foreign trade.

@Estonia:Economy

 Overview: Bolstered by a widespread national desire to reintegrate
 into Western Europe, the Estonian government has pursued an ambitious
 program of market reforms and stabilization measures, which is rapidly
 transforming the economy. Three years after independence - and two
 years after the introduction of the kroon - Estonians are beginning to
 reap tangible benefits; inflation, though still high, was brought down
 to about 2% per month in second half 1994; production declines have
 bottomed out with estimated growth of 4% in 1994; and living standards
 are rising. Economic restructuring has been dramatic. By 1994 the
 service sector accounted for over 55% of GDP, while the once-dominant
 heavy industrial sector continues to shrink. The private sector is
 growing rapidly; the share of the state enterprises in the economy has
 steadily declined and by late 1994 accounted for only about 40% of
 GDP. Estonia's foreign trade has shifted rapidly from East to West;
 the Western industrialized countries now account for two-thirds of
 foreign trade.

@Ethiopia:Economy

 Overview: With the independence of Eritrea on 27 April 1993, Ethiopia
 continues to face difficult economic problems as one of the poorest
 and least developed countries in Africa. Its economy is based on
 agriculture, which accounts for about 45% of GDP, 90% of exports, and
 80% of total employment; coffee generates 60% of export earnings. The
 agricultural sector suffers from frequent periods of drought, poor
 cultivation practices, and deterioration of internal security
 conditions. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
 from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but
 less than 10% of agriculture, is state run. The government is
 considering selling off a portion of state-owned plants, and is
 implementing reform measures that are gradually liberalizing the
 economy. A major medium-term problem is the improvement of roads,
 water supply, and other parts of an infrastructure badly neglected
 during years of civil strife.

@Falkland Islands (islas Malvinas):Economy

 Overview: The economy was formerly based on agriculture, mainly sheep
 farming, which directly or indirectly employs most of the work force.
 Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish winter
 fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to the UK and the
 sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the
 surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So
 far, efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been
 unsuccessful. The economy has diversified since 1987 when the
 government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
 operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license
 fees total more than $40 million per year and support the island's
 health, education, and welfare system. To encourage tourism, the
 Falkland Islands Development Corporation has built three lodges for
 visitors attracted by the abundant wildlife and trout fishing. The
 islands are now self-financing except for defense. The British
 Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around the
 islands in 1993 and early seismic surveys suggest substantial reserves
 capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day.
