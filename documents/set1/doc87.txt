  also an important source of government revenue. During the 1980s
  tourism became one of the most important and highest growth sectors of

  is officially estimated to have increased by about 10% annually during
  the period 1974-90.

@Malta, Economy

Overview: 
  Significant resources are limestone, a favorable geographic location,
  and a productive labor force. Malta produces only about 20% of its
  food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic
  energy sources. Consequently, the economy is highly dependent on
  foreign trade and services. Manufacturing and tourism are the largest
  contributors to the economy. Manufacturing accounts for about 27% of
  GDP, with the electronics and textile industries major contributors
  and the state-owned Malta drydocks which employs about 4,300 people.
  In 1992, about 1,000,000 tourists visited the island. Per capita GDP
  at $6,600 places Malta in the middle-income range of the world's
  nations.

@Man, Isle of, Economy

Overview: 
  Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the
  economy. The government's policy of offering incentives to
  high-technology companies and financial institutions to locate on the
  island has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in
  high-income industries. As a result, agriculture and fishing, once the
  mainstays of the economy, have declined in their shares of GNP.
  Banking now contributes about 45% to GNP. Trade is mostly with the UK.

@Marshall Islands, Economy

Overview: 
  Agriculture and tourism are the mainstays of the economy. Agricultural
  production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important
  commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit. A few
  cattle ranches supply the domestic meat market. Small-scale industry
  is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist
  industry is the primary source of foreign exchange and employs about
  10% of the labor force. The islands have few natural resources, and
  imports far exceed exports. In 1987 the US Government provided grants
  of $40 million out of the Marshallese budget of $55 million.

@Martinique, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism, and light
  industry. Agriculture accounts for about 10% of GDP and the small
  industrial sector for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of
  the sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana exports are
  increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and
  grain requirements must be imported, contributing to a chronic trade
  deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from France.
  Tourism has become more important than agricultural exports as a
  source of foreign exchange. The majority of the work force is employed
  in the service sector and in administration. Banana workers launched
  protests late in 1992 because of falling banana prices and fears of
  greater competition in the European market from other producers.
