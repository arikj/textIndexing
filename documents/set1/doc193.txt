Economy

Economy - overview: Though foreign investment in manufacturing and
information processing in recent years has increased Saint Lucia's
industrial base, the economy remains vulnerable due to its heavy
dependence on banana production, which is subject to periodic droughts
and tropical storms. Indeed, the destructive effect of Tropical Storm
Iris in mid-1995 caused the loss of 20% of the year's banana crop.
Increased competition from Latin American bananas will probably
further reduce market prices, exacerbating Saint Lucia's need to
diversify its economy in coming years, e.g., by further expanding
tourism, manufacturing, and construction.

Economy

Economy - overview: The inhabitants have traditionally earned their
livelihood by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off
the coast of Newfoundland. The economy has been declining, however,
because the number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped
steadily over the years. In 1992, an arbitration panel awarded the
islands an exclusive economic zone of 12,348 sq km to settle a
longstanding territorial dispute with Canada, although it represents
only 25% of what France had sought. The islands are heavily subsidized
by France. Imports come primarily from Canada and France.

Economy

Economy - overview: Agriculture, dominated by banana production, is
the most important sector of this lower middle income economy. The
services sector, based mostly on a growing tourist industry, is also
important. The government has been relatively unsuccessful at
introducing new industries, and high unemployment rates of 35%-40%
continue. The continuing dependence on a single crop represents the
biggest obstacle to the islands' development; tropical storms wiped
out substantial portions of crops in both 1994 and 1995. The tourism
sector has considerable potential for development over the next
decade.

Economy

Economy - overview: This small poor island economy has become
increasingly dependent on cocoa since independence over 20 years ago.
However, cocoa production has substantially declined because of
drought and mismanagement. The resulting shortage of cocoa for export
has created a persistent balance-of-payments problem. Sao Tome has to
import all fuels, most manufactured goods, consumer goods, and a
significant amount of food. Over the years, it has been unable to
service its external debt and has had to depend on concessional aid
and debt rescheduling. Considerable potential exists for development
of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to expand
facilities in recent years. The government also has attempted to
reduce price controls and subsidies, but economic growth has remained
sluggish.
