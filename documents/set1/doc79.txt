@Guadeloupe, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and
  services. It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and
  imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In
  addition, an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the
  islands. The traditionally important sugarcane crop is slowly being
  replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50%
  of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root
  crops are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is
  still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly from France.
  Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production. Most
  manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially
  high among the young.

@Guam, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy depends mainly on US military spending and on revenues
  from tourism. Over the past 20 years the tourist industry has grown
  rapidly, creating a construction boom for new hotels and the expansion
  of older ones. Visitors numbered about 900,000 in 1992. The slowdown
  in Japanese economic growth has been reflected in less vigorous growth
  in the tourism sector. About 60% of the labor force works for the
  private sector and the rest for government. Most food and industrial
  goods are imported, with about 75% from the US. In early 1994, Guam
  faces the problem of building up the civilian economic sector to
  offset the impact of military downsizing.

@Guatemala, Economy

Overview: 
  The economy is based on family and corporate agriculture, which
  accounts for 26% of GDP, employs about 60% of the labor force, and
  supplies two-thirds of exports. Manufacturing, predominantly in
  private hands, accounts for about 18% of GDP and 12% of the labor
  force. In both 1990 and 1991, the economy grew by 3%, the fourth and
  fifth consecutive years of mild growth. In 1992 growth picked up to
  almost 5% as government policies favoring competition and foreign
  trade and investment took stronger hold. In 1993, despite political
  unrest, this momentum continued, foreign investment held up, and
  growth was estimated at 4%.

@Guinea, Economy

Overview: 
  Although possessing major mineral and hydropower resources and
  considerable potential for agricultural development, Guinea remains
  one of the poorest countries in the world. The agricultural sector
  contributes about 40% to GDP and employs more than 80% of the work
  force, while industry accounts for 27% of GDP. Guinea possesses over
  25% of the world's bauxite reserves. The mining sector accounted for
  85% of exports in 1991. Long-run improvements in literacy, financial
  institutions, and the legal framework are needed if the country is to
  move out of poverty. Except in the bauxite industry, foreign
  investment remains minimal.
