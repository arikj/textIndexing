interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge
of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a

felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and
Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation
to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
regimentals of an ensign.
