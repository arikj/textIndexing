Inverted file:

- grouping according to synonyms of words for queries
- position of term in document for proximity query
- tf-idf in inverted index

- Signature files: Re encoding after some time
- Handling editing of file



Data sets description

Graphs:
For each data set,

1) Mean Time for each queries					: indexfile << ver2 < Signature < Compressed << linear	
2) Additional Memory requirements				: Signature < Compressed < ver2 = indexfile
3) Preprocessing Time 							: Signature < indexfile < ver2 < Compressed



Inference:
- Use Signature for space limitation
- Use index file for better time performance

- Compressed index structure increase encoding decoding time
- Compressed phrase query time is high due to random access
